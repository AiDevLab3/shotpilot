### Core Business Model

Higgsfield **pivoted from trying to create long, cohesive video narratives to becoming an aggregator of best-in-class Chinese video generation models**. Instead of betting everything on their own model, they've built a platform that integrates the best available models.

**Platform Strategy:**
- Runs on a proprietary engine optimized for speed and cost-efficiency
- Integrates both its own AI models AND top-tier third-party models
- Currently offers access to models like **Sora 2, Veo 3.1**, and their own **Higgsfield Popcorn** image model
- **Cinema Studio v1.5** is one of their proprietary models
- **Nano Banana Pro** is their proprietary image generation model

**Strategic Positioning:** "While everyone else is trying to win the model wars, Higgsfield is winning the distribution war. They're where creators actually go to make content."
