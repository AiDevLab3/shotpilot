# Cine-AI Knowledge Base Master Index

**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** February 2, 2026

Welcome to the Cine-AI Knowledge Base. This index provides a complete map of all packs, models, and examples in the knowledge base.

## How to Use This Knowledge Base

The Cine-AI Knowledge Base is organized into three main categories:

### 1. **Packs** (Global Constraints)
Packs are universal, model-agnostic guides that define the rules and best practices for achieving specific outcomes (e.g., cinematic realism, character consistency). Think of packs as the **"what"** and **"why"** of your workflow.

### 2. **Models** (Syntax Wrappers)
Model guides provide specific instructions for using individual AI models. They translate the universal principles from packs into model-specific syntax and workflows. Think of models as the **"how"** for each platform.

### 3. **Examples** (Copy/Paste Templates)
Examples provide ready-to-use templates and prompts that demonstrate how to apply the principles from packs and models in real-world scenarios.

- **[Character Consistency Pack v1](../packs/Cine-AI_Character_Consistency_Pack_v1.md)**  
  Maintain character identity, appearance, and personality across multiple shots, scenes, and models.

- **[Quality Control Pack v1](../packs/Cine-AI_Quality_Control_Pack_v1.md)**  
  Identify and fix common AI video artifacts, troubleshoot issues, and refine outputs to professional standards.

- **[Motion Readiness Pack v1](../packs/Cine-AI_Motion_Readiness_Pack_v1.md)**  
  Prepare hero frames for video generation, ensure motion-ready composition, and prevent common video artifacts.

- **[Spatial Composition & Anatomy Pack v1](../packs/Cine-AI_Spatial_Composition_Anatomy_Pack_v1.md)**
