- Describe the change in emotion or pose while maintaining the identity

**High-Resolution & Textures:**
- Explicitly request high resolutions (2K or 4K)
- Describe high-fidelity details (imperfections, surface textures)
- Example: "Harness native high-fidelity output to craft a breathtaking, atmospheric environment of a mossy forest floor. Command complex lighting effects and delicate textures, ensuring every strand of moss and beam of light is rendered in pixel-perfect resolution suitable for a 4K wallpaper."

**Negative Constraints:**
- Define the boundaries of failure
- Explicitly list what to exclude to narrow the model's search space to high-quality results only
- Example: "no watermarks, no extra text, no logos"

**Use High Control for Details:**
- Trick the model into photorealism by specifying camera gear
- Adding tags like "Shot on Arri Alexa" forces the AI to emulate specific film grain

### Quick Tips for Flawless Generations

**Command the Prompt:**
- Models lose focus on conversational filler
- Remove polite phrases like "please"
- Use command-line style syntax to maximize output

**Lock the Seed:**
- Consistency is key for professional work
- Once you achieve a specific result, reuse seeds to generate a consistent series of images

**Coordinate-Level Accuracy:**
- Place objects exactly where you want them
- Use relative positioning, and the model will anchor them with mathematical precision

**Semantic Adherence:**
- The model respects your constraints
- If you specify a rule or detail, it adheres to those optical rules strictly

### Example Cinematic Prompt Structure

```
Ultra-detailed POV shot from inside a transparent container filled with crushed pink ice, looking upward at a young woman leaning over the opening. She sips through a bright blue straw, her lips glossy and slightly parted, eyes wide with playful curiosity. Sunlight illuminates her face and the sparkling ice crystals, creating vibrant reflections and a summery atmosphere. The background shows a clear blue sky, slight lens distortion, and subtle water droplets on the container walls. Hyperrealistic textures, high-contrast colors, cinematic saturation, crisp details, energetic and refreshing mood
```

### Current Limitations
- Visual and text fidelity: Rendering small text, fine details, and accurate spellings may not work perfectly
- Data and factual accuracy: Always verify the factual accuracy of data-driven visuals
- Translation and localization: May make grammar mistakes or miss cultural nuances
- Complex edits and image blending: Can sometimes produce unnatural artifacts
- Character features: Character consistency across edits may vary

### Best Practices for Cinematic Realism
1. Use full sentences and natural language, not keyword tags
2. Provide context (the "why" or "for whom") to help the model make logical artistic decisions
3. Specify camera and lighting details like a cinematographer
4. Use specific camera gear references (e.g., "Shot on Arri Alexa") to force realistic film aesthetics
5. Define aspect ratios numerically (e.g., 16:9, 21:9 for cinematic)
6. Describe textures and materials explicitly
7. Use conversational editing for refinements instead of re-generating from scratch
8. Request high resolutions (2K or 4K) for detail-critical work
9. Use negative constraints to exclude unwanted elements
10. Leverage the model's "thinking" capability by providing detailed, logical prompts
