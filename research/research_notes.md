### Key Insight:
Adding film stock references is far more precise than using vague terms like "cinematic" or "vintage". Film stocks provide instant, consistent aesthetic control without needing to describe complex technical details.

### Camera Stacking Technique:
Stack camera types, lenses, and film styles for signature look:
- "DSLR photo with an 85mm lens, shot on Kodak Portra 400, soft window light"
- Pair with lighting styles: "golden hour," "hard flash," "Rembrandt lighting"

### Prompt Structure Best Practices:

**Effective Order:**
1. Subject (main focus)
2. Key details
3. Setting
4. Lighting
5. Style references

**Example:**
"An empty stylish office chair behind a trestle desk in the early morning light in a modern glass Italian architect's office in Milan, FujiColor C200"

### Lighting Through Time of Day:

**Why It Works:**
Using time of day helps get mood better than being overly specific about lighting type. Natural phrases work well.

**Examples:**
- "early morning light" = soft, directional, warm temperature, long shadows, peaceful
- "middle of the day" = bright, harsh, high contrast
- "late at night" = dark, moody, artificial light sources
- "early evening" = golden hour, warm glow

**Seasonal Lighting:**
Adding seasons creates specific feelings:
- "autumn rainy morning light" = dark, gloomy, wet
- Creates consistency better than describing lighting itself

### Cultural and Style References:

**Why They Work:**
Cultural references tap into AI's training on countless images associated with these concepts.

**Examples:**
- "Italian architect's office" = clean, sophisticated design, high-quality materials, attention to proportions
- "American architect's office in New York" = different aesthetic sensibility
- "Scandinavian architecture" = minimalist, clean lines, natural light

### What to Avoid:

**Generic Terms:**
- Avoid vague terms like "cinematic" or "vintage" without specifics
- Don't use "photorealistic" or "hyperrealistic" - just use "photo"

**Generic Personality Descriptors:**
- Avoid "confident CEO" = leads to forced, inauthentic body language
- Instead be specific: "woman CEO in tailored green suit, standing in office"

**LLM-Generated Prompts:**
- Often choose "cheesy" and overused descriptions
- Can make images feel generic and predictable

### Representation Considerations:

**Bias Awareness:**
- AI has inherent human biases
- Consider gender, race, cultural heritage, age, ability in prompts
- Body images skew towards slim by default
- Use natural language like "stocky man" for realistic representation
