## Introduction: The Cinematographer's Toolkit

Higgsfield Cinema Studio V1.5 is a specialized tool designed for creators who think like cinematographers. It moves beyond simple text-to-image generation by offering a deterministic, physics-based workflow that simulates a real-world film set. The core philosophy is "Hero Frame First," which emphasizes perfecting a single still image before animating it. This guide provides accurate, verified specifications and workflows for Cinema Studio V1.5.

## Core Philosophy: Hero Frame First

The foundation of any great video shot is a perfect still image. Cinema Studio is built around this principle. Before you can create motion, you must first establish your "Hero Frame"—a single, perfectly composed image that locks in the lighting, character details, and overall mood. This ensures that your final animation maintains a consistent, high-quality aesthetic from start to finish.

## The Workflow: From Still to Motion

The process is divided into two distinct phases: building the rig and directing the motion. This separation allows for meticulous control over every aspect of the final output.

### Phase 1: Build the Rig & Shoot Your Image

In this phase, your goal is to create the perfect Hero Frame using Cinema Studio's UI-based dropdown selection system.

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Select Your Gear** | Choose camera body, lens, focal length, and aperture from dropdown menus. | Each combination produces a unique aesthetic based on real optical physics. |
| **2. Write Your Script** | Enter a detailed prompt describing the scene, subject, and lighting. | Be specific and descriptive, as you would when briefing a photographer. |
| **3. Generate & Select** | Create a batch of images in 21:9 aspect ratio and choose your Hero Frame. | This image becomes the foundation for your animation. |
| **4. Handoff to Video** | Use "Use as ref for video" to move to animation phase. | This locks in the visual style of your Hero Frame. |

**Rig Build:**
- **Camera:** Arriflex 16SR (16mm Film)
- **Lens:** Canon K-35 (Vintage character)
- **Focal Length:** 35mm (Natural perspective)
- **Aperture:** f/4 (Balanced depth of field)

**Prompt:**
```
A cinematic still of a world-weary detective in a cluttered office at night. He sits at his desk, illuminated by a single desk lamp, with deep shadows obscuring the corners of the room. The air is thick with cigarette smoke, and rain streaks down the window behind him. The scene is shot with a gritty, desaturated color palette, emphasizing the textures of the wood, paper, and worn leather.
```

### Example 2: Epic Sci-Fi Landscape

**Rig Build:**
- **Camera:** IMAX Film Camera (Large format)
- **Lens:** Hawk V-Lite (Anamorphic)
- **Focal Length:** 14mm (Wide angle)
- **Aperture:** f/11 (Deep focus)

**Prompt:**
```
A breathtaking alien landscape at golden hour, with towering crystalline structures rising from a vast desert. The low sun creates dramatic horizontal lens flares across the frame. A lone explorer in a spacesuit stands in the foreground, dwarfed by the scale of the environment. Shot in anamorphic widescreen with deep focus capturing every detail from foreground to horizon.
```

### Example 3: Intimate Portrait

**Rig Build:**
- **Camera:** Sony Venice (Digital clarity)
- **Lens:** Cooke S4 (Soft, flattering)
- **Focal Length:** 50mm (Portrait)
- **Aperture:** f/1.4 (Shallow depth of field)

**Prompt:**
```
A close-up portrait of a young woman in soft window light, her face turned slightly toward the camera with a contemplative expression. The background is completely out of focus, creating a dreamy bokeh. Warm, natural lighting with subtle rim light defining her profile. Shot with the classic Cooke Look for soft, flattering skin tones.
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with the rig, then write the prompt** - Your camera/lens selection defines the visual character; your prompt describes the content
2. **Match focal length to shot type** - 8mm/14mm for wide shots, 35mm for medium, 50mm for close-ups
3. **Use aperture strategically** - f/1.4 for isolation, f/11 for deep focus, f/4 for versatility
4. **Generate multiple Hero Frames** - Create a batch and select the best one
5. **Lock your Hero Frame before animating** - This ensures visual consistency in the final video
6. **Describe lighting explicitly** - Cinema Studio responds well to specific lighting descriptions
7. **Think like a cinematographer** - Consider composition, depth, and visual storytelling

## Technical Notes

- **Input Method:** UI-based dropdown selections (NOT JSON)
- **Default Aspect Ratio:** 21:9 CinemaScope (V1.5 adds additional ratios)
- **Output Quality:** 16-bit HD images, professional cinematic video
- **Character Consistency:** Reference Anchor system locks facial geometry and wardrobe
- **Video Model Selection:** Cinema Studio automatically selects the best underlying model (Veo, Kling, etc.)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ Using focal lengths not available (only 8, 14, 35, 50mm exist)
2. ❌ Using apertures not available (only f/1.4, f/4, f/11 exist)
3. ❌ Skipping the Hero Frame step and going straight to video
4. ❌ Writing vague prompts without lighting/composition details
5. ❌ Ignoring the camera/lens selection and relying only on prompts
6. ❌ Expecting JSON input (Cinema Studio uses UI dropdowns)
