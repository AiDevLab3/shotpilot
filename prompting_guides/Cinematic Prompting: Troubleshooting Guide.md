# Cinematic Prompting: Troubleshooting Guide

## Introduction

Even with a perfect prompt, AI image generators can sometimes produce results that aren't quite right. This guide provides practical solutions to three of the most common problems: images that are too dark, too flat, or lack cinematic depth. By making targeted adjustments to your lighting, camera, and composition prompts, you can quickly diagnose and fix these issues.

## Problem 1: The Image is Too Dark or Underexposed

This often happens when the lighting isn't described with enough intensity or when the camera settings imply a low-light environment.

| Cause | Solution | Example Prompt Adjustment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Insufficient Lighting** | Add more light sources or increase their intensity. Use terms that imply brightness. | **Before:** `A detective in his office.`<br>**After:** `A detective in his brightly lit office, with daylight streaming through the window and a desk lamp turned on.` |
| **Low-Key Style** | Explicitly ask for a high-key lighting setup, which emphasizes brightness and minimizes shadows. | **Before:** `A portrait of a woman.`<br>**After:** `A high-key portrait of a woman, with soft, even lighting and a bright white background.` |
| **Narrow Aperture** | Widen the camera's aperture to let in more light. A smaller f-number (e.g., f/1.8) means a wider aperture. | **Before:** `...shot with an aperture of f/11.`<br>**After:** `...shot with a wide aperture of f/2.8.` |

## Problem 2: The Image is Too Flat or Lacks Contrast

Flatness occurs when there is not enough difference between the light and dark areas of the image. The key is to create contrast and define edges.

| Cause | Solution | Example Prompt Adjustment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Diffused Lighting** | Introduce a strong, directional light source. Use terms that create sharp shadows. | **Before:** `...lit by soft, overcast daylight.`<br>**After:** `...lit by a single, harsh overhead spotlight, creating deep shadows (chiaroscuro).` |
| **Lack of Separation** | Add a **rim light** or **backlight**. This technique traces the subject's outline with light, separating them from the background. | **Before:** `A character standing in a dark room.`<br>**After:** `A character standing in a dark room, with a strong golden rim light defining their silhouette.` |
| **Uniform Atmosphere** | Add atmospheric elements that create layers and texture. | **Before:** `A forest scene.`<br>**After:** `A forest scene with thick fog and shafts of light breaking through the canopy.` |

## Problem 3: The Image Lacks Cinematic Depth

This issue arises when the image feels two-dimensional. Creating depth involves separating the foreground, midground, and background, and making the light feel tangible.

| Cause | Solution | Example Prompt Adjustment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Deep Focus** | Create a **shallow depth of field (DoF)** by using a wider aperture. This keeps the subject sharp while blurring the background. | **Before:** `A portrait of a man, f/8.`<br>**After:** `A portrait of a man, shot with a very shallow depth of field at f/1.4.` |
| **Wide-Angle Lens** | Use a longer **focal length** (e.g., 85mm, 135mm). This compresses the background and creates a more intimate, portrait-like feel. | **Before:** `...shot with a 24mm wide-angle lens.`<br>**After:** `...shot with an 85mm telephoto lens to compress the background.` |
| **Flat Lighting** | Make the light itself a three-dimensional element by using **volumetric lighting**. | **Before:** `Sunlight coming through a window.`<br>**After:** `Volumetric light shafts (God rays) coming through a window, illuminating the dust particles in the air.` |
| **Empty Foreground** | Add foreground elements to create a sense of looking *into* the scene. | **Before:** `A couple having dinner.`<br>**After:** `A shot of a couple having dinner, framed by a wine glass and a candle in the foreground.` |
