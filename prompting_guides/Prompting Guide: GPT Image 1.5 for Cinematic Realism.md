## Introduction: The Structured Approach

GPT Image 1.5, developed by OpenAI, excels at producing high-fidelity photorealistic images by understanding structured, detailed prompts. Its core strength lies in its ability to interpret prompts like a creative brief, allowing for precise control over scene elements, lighting, and composition. The key to mastering this model is to move away from simple keyword lists and adopt a more descriptive, iterative process that mirrors a real-world creative workflow. This guide provides a framework for leveraging GPT Image 1.5 to create stunningly realistic cinematic stills.

## Core Philosophy: Prompt Like a Director

To achieve cinematic realism with GPT Image 1.5, you must think like a director briefing a cinematographer. The model responds best to prompts that are structured logically, starting with the broad environment and progressively adding specific details. This method ensures that every element is considered and placed correctly within the scene.

## Prompting Fundamentals

A successful prompt for GPT Image 1.5 follows a consistent order and includes specific quality cues. This structure helps the model build the image layer by layer, from background to foreground.

| Component | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Scene/Background** | Establish the environment, location, and time of day. | `A dimly lit, smoky jazz club in 1950s New York.` |
| **2. Subject** | Describe the main character or object in detail. | `A lone trumpet player, a man in his late 40s with a weathered face.` |
| **3. Key Details** | Add specifics about the subject’s appearance and action. | `He wears a rumpled suit and a fedora, his eyes closed in concentration as he plays.` |
| **4. Constraints & Style** | Define the visual medium, lighting, and composition. | `A photorealistic candid shot, 35mm film grain, high-contrast chiaroscuro lighting.` |

### Best Practices for Photorealism

To create images that feel like authentic photographs rather than staged renders, incorporate the following best practices:

*   **Use Photography Language:** Instead of generic terms like "ultra-detailed," use specific photographic terminology. This steers the model toward a more realistic output.
*   **Embrace Imperfection:** Realism is found in flaws. Explicitly ask for textures that show age and use, such as `weathered skin with visible wrinkles`, `worn fabric on the chair`, or `subtle dust motes in the air`.
*   **Specify the Medium:** Clearly state the desired visual medium. Phrases like `Shot like a 35mm film photograph` or `A candid shot from a vintage Leica camera` provide strong stylistic direction.
*   **Control the Light:** Describe the lighting with precision. Use terms like `soft diffuse light from a window`, `harsh overhead spotlight`, or `golden hour backlighting` to define the mood and shadows.

## Advanced Techniques

### Iterative Refinement

For complex scenes, it is more effective to build the image in stages rather than providing a single, overloaded prompt. Start with a basic prompt to establish the core scene, then use follow-up prompts to add or modify details.

> **Initial Prompt:** `A wide shot of an empty, rain-slicked city street at night, with neon signs reflecting on the wet pavement.`
> 
> **Follow-up Prompt:** `Now, add a solitary figure in a trench coat walking away from the camera under a streetlamp.`

### Text in Images

GPT Image 1.5 has robust text rendering capabilities. To ensure accuracy, follow these guidelines:

*   Place literal text in **quotes** or **ALL CAPS**.
*   Specify typography details like font style, size, color, and placement.
*   For difficult or uncommon words, spell them out letter-by-letter to improve accuracy.

### Example Cinematic Prompt

This example combines all the principles to create a highly specific, cinematic image.

```
Create a photorealistic candid photograph of an old fisherman mending his nets on a weathered wooden dock.

**Scene:** A foggy morning in a quiet New England harbor. The air is thick with mist, and the water is calm.
**Subject:** An elderly fisherman, his face etched with deep wrinkles and sunspots. He has a thick, white beard and wears a heavy, dark blue wool sweater with visible pilling and a faded watch cap.
**Action:** He is focused on his work, his hands deftly repairing a hole in a fishing net draped over his lap.
**Style & Constraints:** Shot like a 35mm film photograph with a 50mm lens. The lighting is soft and diffused due to the fog, creating gentle shadows. The color palette is muted, with cool blues and grays dominating. The image should feel honest and unposed, with realistic skin texture and worn materials. No glamorization or heavy retouching.
```

This structured and descriptive approach provides GPT Image 1.5 with the necessary information to generate a deeply atmospheric and realistic cinematic still that tells a story.
