## Introduction

This Master Prompt Template integrates the best practices from the Universal Framework for cinematic image generation into a single, comprehensive structure. It is designed to be a universal starting point, adaptable to any AI image generation model by simply filling in the placeholders and adding the appropriate model-specific parameters at the end. The goal is to move beyond simple keywords and adopt the mindset of a director, cinematographer, and production designer all in one.

## How to Use This Template

1.  **Copy the entire template structure.**
2.  **Fill in the placeholders `[ ]` for each section.** Be as specific and descriptive as possible.
3.  **Delete any sections that are not relevant** to your specific image (e.g., if there is no character, delete the Character Detail section).
4.  **Add the model-specific parameters** in the final section.
5.  **Use the complete text** as your prompt.

## Example Filled Template

**Concept:** A cinematic still from a modern sci-fi noir film.

**Filled Prompt:**

A cinematic still from a modern sci-fi noir film, in the style of Denis Villeneuve. The scene has a somber, contemplative mood and a tense, mysterious atmosphere.

The setting is a rain-slicked, neon-lit alleyway in a futuristic, dystopian metropolis at midnight during a heavy downpour.

The subject is a lone android detective, his chrome-plated face partially obscured by the shadow of his wide-brimmed hat. He is leaning against a graffiti-covered brick wall, staring intently at a flickering holographic advertisement across the street. His expression is one of weary resignation.

He is wearing a worn, synthetic leather trench coat that realistically drapes over his metallic frame, with visible scuffs and water droplets beading on the surface. His exposed facial plates show micro-scratches and a subtle, matte texture.

Shot on an ARRI Alexa 35 using a Hawk V-lite Anamorphic lens. The focal length is 35mm with an aperture of f/4, creating a balanced depth of field with cinematic oval bokeh from the background lights.

This is a medium wide shot from a low angle, making the towering skyscrapers feel oppressive. The composition uses the leading lines of the alley to draw the viewer's eye to the detective.

The scene is lit by the harsh, colorful glow of the neon signs, creating strong rim lighting on the detective's silhouette and casting deep, dramatic shadows. The color palette is dominated by cool blues and electric pinks, with high contrast.

Avoid oversaturated colors, digital noise, motion blur, or any text that is not part of the holographic advertisement.
