# Product Naming  ## Current - **Repo codename:** Cine-AI - **Product name:** TBD  ## Rule - **Do not hardcode the product name in filenames.**   - Prefer neutral filenames (e.g., `Cinematic_Realism_Pack_v1.md`) over brand-prefixed filenames.   - If branding is needed inside documents, use "(working name)" or reference the repo codename.  ## Notes - When the product name is finalized, update UI copy and marketing-facing docs first. - Avoid mass renames until after the product name is locked.
