## The Avatar 2.0 Revolution

### The Problem: The Uncanny Valley and Identity Drift

AI avatar generation has long struggled with two critical challenges that prevented professional adoption:

**The Uncanny Valley:** Early avatar models produced characters that looked almost human but fell into the "uncanny valley"—close enough to human to be recognizable, but different enough to be unsettling. Subtle imperfections in facial movement, eye tracking, and expression timing created an eerie, artificial quality that undermined believability.

**Identity Drift:** Perhaps more critically, avatar models couldn't maintain consistent character identity beyond a few seconds. As generation progressed, characters would experience:
- **Facial feature changes** (eye color, nose shape, facial structure)
- **Clothing flickering** (outfits changing mid-clip or disappearing)
- **Hair inconsistencies** (style, length, color shifting)
- **Accessory disappearance** (glasses, jewelry vanishing)
- **Expression inconsistency** (micro-expressions and mannerisms changing)

These issues made it impossible to create professional content requiring character consistency—tutorials, presentations, narratives, or any content longer than a few seconds.

### The Solution: Unified Character Memory

Kling Avatars 2.0 introduces the **Unified Character Memory** system, a revolutionary architecture that fundamentally solves identity drift. This system maintains a persistent character representation throughout the entire generation process, ensuring that every aspect of the character—from facial features to clothing details to behavioral nuances—remains absolutely consistent for up to 5 continuous minutes.

**How It Works:**

The Unified Character Memory creates a comprehensive character model from the reference image that includes:
- **Geometric Identity:** 3D facial structure, body proportions, spatial relationships
- **Texture Identity:** Skin texture, hair texture, fabric patterns, material properties
- **Stylistic Identity:** Artistic style, rendering quality, visual aesthetic
- **Behavioral Identity:** Micro-expressions, gesture patterns, movement style

This character model is locked in at generation start and referenced continuously throughout the 5-minute duration, ensuring unwavering consistency regardless of:
- Camera angle changes
- Lighting variations
- Complex character movements
- Environmental interactions
- Stylistic transitions

**Result:** True narrative potential. Creators can build entire scenes, deliver complete monologues, teach full tutorials, and tell character-driven stories with a single generation—no stitching, no re-generation, no identity drift.

### The Paradigm Shift

**Before Kling Avatars 2.0:**
- Identity drift beyond 3-5 seconds
- Clothing flickering and changes
- Inconsistent facial expressions
- Limited to very short clips
- Required complex stitching of multiple generations
- Days or weeks of traditional animation for consistent characters

**After Kling Avatars 2.0:**
- 5-minute consistent identity (300 seconds)
- Locked-in outfit details (zero flickering)
- Retained micro-expressions and mannerisms
- Extended duration in single generation
- No stitching required
- Minutes of generation time

**Impact:** Kling Avatars 2.0 proves that AI-driven character generation can be not just fast and realistic, but deeply consistent, emotionally intelligent, and ready for true storytelling.

**What It Controls:**
- Facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, face shape)
- Skin tone and texture
- Hair style, color, and texture
- Clothing and outfit
- Accessories (glasses, jewelry, etc.)
- Artistic style (photorealistic, illustrated, stylized)
- Overall visual aesthetic

**What It Doesn't Control:**
- Motion or movement
- Speech or dialogue
- Gestures or behavior
- Camera angles

**Requirements:**
- Single image (not video or multiple images)
- Clear view of character
- High quality preferred
- Any style supported (photorealistic, illustrated, cartoon, etc.)

### Input 2: Audio File (Performance Driver)

**Purpose:** Drives the avatar's performance through voice and sound

**What It Controls:**
- Speech content and dialogue

**Purpose:** Guides motion, gestures, and cinematic behavior

**What It Controls:**
- Physical movements (walking, gesturing, nodding)
- Hand gestures and body language
- Camera angles and movements
- Cinematic style (handheld, static, push-in)
- Atmosphere and mood
- Lighting and environment context

**What It Doesn't Control:**
- Visual appearance (image handles this)
- Speech content (audio handles this)
- Lip-sync (audio handles this)

**Requirements:**
- Text description of desired motion and cinematic behavior
- Focus on "how" character moves, not "what" they look like or say
- Can include camera directions and atmospheric details

### The Division of Labor

Understanding the division of labor between inputs is critical:

| Aspect | Controlled By | Example |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| Face shape | Image | Oval face, high cheekbones |
| Clothing | Image | Red dress, blue suit |
| Hair style | Image | Long flowing hair, short buzz cut |
| Speech content | Audio | "Hello, welcome to my channel" |
| Voice tone | Audio | Enthusiastic, calm, serious |
| Lip movements | Audio | Synchronized to speech |
| Hand gestures | Text Prompt | "add subtle hand gestures" |
| Walking | Text Prompt | "walks slowly through courtyard" |
| Camera angle | Text Prompt | "medium shot, push-in to close-up" |
| Mood | Text Prompt | "late-afternoon sun, unpolished realism" |

**Key Principle:** Don't describe in text prompt what the image or audio already defines. Focus each input on its specific role.

## Unified Character Memory

The Unified Character Memory is Kling Avatars 2.0's defining innovation. Understanding how it works enables you to leverage its full potential.

### What Is Unified Character Memory?

Unified Character Memory is a persistent character representation system that maintains every aspect of a character's identity throughout the entire 5-minute generation. Think of it as a "character blueprint" that the model continuously references to ensure consistency.

**Components of the Character Memory:**

**1. Geometric Identity**
- 3D facial structure and proportions
- Body shape and size
- Spatial relationships between features
- Bone structure and skeletal framework
- Depth and volume information

**2. Texture Identity**
- Skin texture and pore detail
- Hair texture and strand patterns
- Fabric texture and weave
- Material properties (glossy, matte, rough, smooth)
- Surface detail and imperfections

**3. Color Identity**
- Skin tone and color
- Hair color and highlights
- Clothing colors and patterns
- Eye color
- Makeup and cosmetic details

**4. Stylistic Identity**
- Artistic style (photorealistic, illustrated, stylized)
- Rendering quality and detail level
- Visual aesthetic and mood
- Lighting style preferences
- Post-processing effects

**5. Behavioral Identity**
- Micro-expression patterns
- Gesture tendencies
- Movement style (graceful, energetic, reserved)
- Personality indicators
- Behavioral nuances

### Long-Form Identity Coherence

**5-Minute Consistency:**

The Unified Character Memory enables unprecedented 5-minute (300-second) consistency across all character aspects:

**Facial Features:** Eyes, nose, mouth, face shape, bone structure—all remain absolutely consistent. No morphing, no drift, no subtle changes that accumulate over time.

**Hair:** Style, length, color, texture, and even individual strand patterns remain locked in. No hair flickering, no style changes, no color shifts.

**Clothing:** The most challenging aspect for previous models, clothing is now completely stable. Outfits remain consistent through complex movements, camera angle changes, and character interactions. No flickering, no disappearing elements, no texture changes.

**Accessories:** Glasses, jewelry, hats, and other accessories stay in place and maintain their appearance throughout. No vanishing accessories, no position drift.

**Regardless of:**
- Camera angle changes (front view → side view → back view)
- Lighting variations (bright → dim → colored lighting)
- Complex character movements (walking, turning, gesturing)
- Environmental interactions (sitting, standing, moving through spaces)
- Stylistic transitions (mood changes, time-of-day shifts)

### Micro-Expression and Mannerism Retention

Beyond static features, the Unified Character Memory maintains behavioral consistency:

**Micro-Expressions:** Subtle facial movements that convey emotion—eyebrow raises, lip curls, eye squints—remain consistent with the character's personality. If the character has a tendency to smile with one corner of the mouth, that mannerism persists throughout.

**Gesture Patterns:** If the reference image or initial motion suggests certain gesture patterns (e.g., hand-talking, reserved movements), those patterns are retained throughout the 5-minute duration.

**Movement Style:** The character's overall movement style—whether graceful, energetic, reserved, or confident—remains consistent, creating a coherent personality.

**Result:** Characters don't just look consistent; they behave consistently, creating truly believable digital personas.

### Dynamic Outfit Consistency

One of the most impressive achievements of Unified Character Memory is dynamic outfit consistency—solving a major pain point of previous avatar models.

**The Problem (Previous Models):**
- Clothing would flicker or change texture mid-clip
- Patterns would shift or disappear
- Colors would drift
- Fabric would morph into different materials
- Accessories would vanish

**The Solution (Avatar 2.0):**

The Unified Character Memory locks in every detail of the outfit from the reference image:
- **Fabric Type:** Cotton, silk, leather, denim—material properties maintained
- **Patterns:** Stripes, checks, prints—patterns stay consistent
- **Colors:** Exact color values preserved
- **Fit and Drape:** How clothing fits and moves with the body remains natural
- **Details:** Buttons, zippers, pockets, seams—all details preserved

**Maintained Through:**
- Complex movements (walking, sitting, turning)
- Character interactions (gesturing, reaching)
- Camera angle changes (outfit visible from all angles)
- Lighting variations (fabric appearance consistent across lighting)

**Result:** Seamless continuity that enables professional content creation without worrying about clothing artifacts.

## Audio-Driven Animation

The true magic of Kling Avatars 2.0 lies in its audio-driven animation capabilities. The uploaded audio file is the primary driver of the avatar's performance, choreographing the entire character animation.

### Input-Driven Performance

**Audio as Primary Driver:**

Unlike traditional animation where animators manually keyframe every movement, Avatar 2.0 analyzes the uploaded audio file and automatically generates appropriate animation:

**Audio Analysis Pipeline:**

**1. Phoneme Analysis**
- Breaks down speech into individual phonetic sounds
- Identifies each phoneme (smallest unit of sound)
- Maps phonemes to visemes (visual mouth shapes)
- Determines timing of each sound

**2. Rhythm Detection**
- Identifies speech rhythm and pacing
- Detects stressed and unstressed syllables
- Maps rhythm to motion timing
- Guides overall performance pacing

**3. Cadence Mapping**
- Analyzes speech cadence (rise and fall of voice)
- Maps cadence to head movements and gestures
- Creates natural pauses and emphasis
- Guides breathing patterns

**4. Emotion Extraction**
- Analyzes emotional tone of voice
- Identifies emotions (happy, sad, excited, calm, etc.)
- Determines intensity of emotion
- Guides facial expressions and body language

**5. Motion Choreography**
- Generates appropriate movements based on audio analysis
- Synchronizes gestures with speech emphasis
- Creates natural pauses and transitions
- Maintains consistent performance style

**Result:** The avatar's entire performance is choreographed by the audio, creating seamless synchronization between what is heard and what is seen.

### Advanced Lip-Sync & Emotion Sync

**Industry-Leading Lip-Sync:**

Kling Avatars 2.0 boasts the most accurate lip-sync in the industry, perfectly matching speech to mouth movements:

**Phoneme-to-Viseme Mapping:**
- Each speech sound (phoneme) maps to a specific mouth shape (viseme)
- Example: "M" sound → lips closed
- Example: "A" sound → mouth open wide
- Example: "F" sound → lower lip touches upper teeth

**Timing Precision:**
- Mouth movements are frame-accurate to audio
- No lag or desynchronization
- Smooth transitions between mouth shapes
- Natural co-articulation (blending between sounds)

**Language Support:**
- Works across multiple languages
- Adapts to different phonetic systems
- Handles accents and dialects
- Supports non-speech audio (humming, laughing, etc.)

**Beyond Lip-Sync: Emotion Sync:**

Avatar 2.0 goes far beyond basic lip-sync to synchronize the entire character's emotional state with the voice:

**Micro-Expression Sync:**
- Eyebrow movements match voice emphasis
- Eye squints and widening reflect emotion
- Nose wrinkles and cheek raises align with speech
- Forehead tension matches emotional intensity

**Body Language Coordination:**
- Posture reflects emotional state (confident, reserved, excited)
- Shoulder movements match speech rhythm
- Head tilts and nods emphasize points
- Overall body tension aligns with emotion

**Eye Movement Sync:**
- Eye direction matches speech intent (looking at camera, looking away)
- Blinking patterns natural to speech and emotion
- Eye contact timing appropriate to content
- Gaze shifts emphasize points or pauses

**Breathing Simulation:**
- Natural breathing patterns during speech
- Breath pauses between phrases
- Chest and shoulder movement during breathing
- Breathing rate matches emotional state

**Result:** Emotionally resonant performances that feel directed and intentional, not mechanically animated.

### Dynamic Pacing and Scene Integration

For longer outputs (up to 5 minutes), Avatar 2.0's audio-aware intelligence guides the avatar's overall presence:

**Pacing Control:**
- Faster speech → more energetic movements
- Slower speech → calmer, more measured movements
- Pauses → natural holds and transitions
- Emphasis → gesture timing and intensity

**Scene Integration:**
- Avatar presence matches audio mood
- Environment interaction feels natural
- Camera angles complement audio pacing
- Overall performance feels cohesive

**Believable Performance:**
- Feels directed, not simply animated
- Natural flow from moment to moment
- Appropriate energy level throughout
- Professional presentation quality

**Result:** Unparalleled realism in character performance, making Avatar 2.0 indispensable for virtual presenters, educational content, and character-driven narratives.

## Image-Driven Character Creation

The reference image is the foundation of your avatar's appearance. Understanding how Avatar 2.0 interprets and reconstructs characters from images is essential for optimal results.

### Single-Image Identity Transfer

**From 2D to 3D:**

Upload a single 2D image, and Kling Avatars 2.0 reconstructs a fully 3D-aware, animatable avatar. This is a sophisticated process that goes far beyond simple style transfer:

**Reconstruction Process:**

**1. Facial Analysis**
- Identifies facial landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth, jawline)
- Extracts 3D geometry from 2D image
- Estimates depth and volume
- Reconstructs facial structure

**2. Texture Extraction**
- Captures skin texture and detail
- Extracts hair texture and patterns
- Identifies clothing fabric and texture
- Preserves material properties

**3. Style Understanding**
- Identifies artistic style (photorealistic, illustrated, stylized)
- Understands rendering quality
- Recognizes visual aesthetic
- Preserves stylistic choices

**4. 3D Avatar Construction**
- Builds 3D character model from 2D image
- Creates animatable rig (skeletal structure for movement)
- Applies textures to 3D model
- Preserves style in 3D space

**What Is Captured:**

**Intricate Facial Details:**
- Eye shape, color, and iris detail
- Nose shape and nostril definition
- Mouth shape and lip detail
- Facial structure and bone definition
- Wrinkles, moles, and skin imperfections

**Skin Texture:**
- Pore detail and skin texture
- Skin tone and color variation
- Lighting and shadow patterns
- Subsurface scattering (skin translucency)

**Hair Style:**
- Hair length and volume
- Hair color and highlights
- Hair texture (straight, wavy, curly)
- Individual strand patterns
- Hairstyle and parting

**Clothing:**
- Outfit style and fit
- Fabric type and texture
- Colors and patterns
- Details (buttons, zippers, seams)
- Accessories (jewelry, glasses, hats)

**Result:** A fully 3D-aware, animatable avatar that captures the unique visual identity of the reference image.

### Stylistic Preservation

**Flexible Input Styles:**

Avatar 2.0 supports a wide range of input styles, faithfully preserving the artistic aesthetic throughout the 5-minute generation:

**Photorealistic Portraits:**
- Real human photographs
- High-fidelity detail
- Natural lighting and texture
- Realistic rendering

**Detailed Illustrations:**
- Digital paintings
- Traditional art scanned
- Artistic interpretation
- Stylized but detailed

**Stylized Concept Art:**
- Anime/manga style
- Cartoon aesthetic
- Simplified features
- Exaggerated proportions

**Cartoon/Animated Characters:**
- 2D animation style
- Simplified shapes
- Bold colors
- Expressive features

**Consistency Throughout:**

Regardless of input style, Avatar 2.0 maintains that style consistently for the entire 5-minute duration:
- Photorealistic input → Photorealistic output throughout
- Anime input → Anime style throughout
- Illustrated input → Illustrated style throughout
- Cartoon input → Cartoon style throughout

**No Style Drift:** The artistic style remains locked in from the reference image, ensuring visual coherence across the entire generation.

### Flexible Character Control (Prompt-Driven Motion)

**Important Distinction:**

The reference image defines appearance. The text prompt defines motion and behavior. These are separate, non-overlapping roles.

**Text Prompt Function:**

The text prompt is used **exclusively** to guide:
- Physical movements (walking, gesturing, nodding)
- Hand gestures and body language
- Camera angles and movements
- Cinematic style (handheld, static, push-in)
- Atmosphere and mood
- Lighting and environment context

**Text Prompt Does NOT Control:**
- Facial features (image handles this)
- Clothing (image handles this)
- Hair style (image handles this)
- Speech content (audio handles this)
- Lip-sync (audio handles this)

**Example Motion Prompts:**

```
add subtle hand gestures
```

```
perform a gentle head nod
```

```
medium shot, then a subtle push-in to a close-up
```

```
walks slowly through quiet traditional courtyard, gives a half-smile
```

```
looks directly into camera
```

```
handheld cinematic shot, late-afternoon sun, unpolished realism
```

**Result:** Streamlined character creation process. Image defines "what," audio defines "what they say," and prompt defines "how they move."

---

## Motion Prompt Framework

The text prompt in Avatar 2.0 has a specific, focused role: guiding motion, gestures, and cinematic behavior. Understanding how to craft effective motion prompts is essential.

### Prompt Structure

**Recommended Structure:**

```
[Cinematic Style] [Character Motion/Behavior], [Camera Movement], [Atmosphere/Mood]
```

**Component Breakdown:**

**1. Cinematic Style**
- Visual aesthetic and filming approach
- Examples: "Photorealistic," "Handheld," "Static shot," "Cinematic"

**4. Atmosphere/Mood**
- Environmental and emotional context
- Examples: "late-afternoon sun," "unpolished realism," "warm lighting," "peaceful atmosphere"

### Motion-Focused Prompts

Since appearance and speech are handled by image and audio, prompts should focus exclusively on motion and cinematic behavior.

**Focus On:**

**Physical Movements:**
- Walking, running, sitting, standing
- Turning, rotating, leaning
- Reaching, pointing, touching
- Any body movement

**Hand Gestures:**
- "add subtle hand gestures"
- "emphasize points with hand movements"
- "keeps hands at sides"
- "gestures expressively"

**Head Movements:**
- "gentle head nod"
- "shakes head"
- "tilts head thoughtfully"
- "looks up/down/left/right"

**Facial Behavior:**
- "gives a half-smile"
- "maintains serious expression"
- "looks directly into camera"
- "glances away occasionally"

**Camera Angles:**
- "medium shot"
- "close-up"
- "wide shot"
- "over-the-shoulder"

**Camera Movements:**
- "static camera"
- "slow push-in"
- "pull-out to reveal environment"
- "tracking shot following character"

**Cinematic Style:**
- "handheld cinematic shot"
- "smooth steadicam movement"
- "documentary style"
- "professional presentation"

**Atmosphere:**
- "late-afternoon sun"
- "warm lighting"
- "soft natural light"
- "dramatic lighting"

**Mood:**
- "unpolished realism"
- "professional atmosphere"
- "casual and relaxed"
- "formal presentation"

**Avoid:**

**Describing Appearance:**
❌ "woman with long hair wearing red dress" (image handles this)
✅ "walks slowly, gives a half-smile" (motion only)

**Describing Speech:**
❌ "says 'hello, welcome to my channel'" (audio handles this)
✅ "looks directly into camera while speaking" (behavior only)

**Describing Facial Features:**
❌ "blue eyes, high cheekbones" (image handles this)
✅ "maintains eye contact with camera" (behavior only)

### Example Prompts

**Example 1: Photorealistic Courtyard Scene**
```
Photorealistic, handheld cinematic shot: walks through a quiet traditional courtyard, gives a half-smile, late-afternoon sun, unpolished realism
```

**Breakdown:**
- Cinematic Style: "Photorealistic, handheld cinematic shot"
- Motion: "walks through a quiet traditional courtyard, gives a half-smile"
- Atmosphere: "late-afternoon sun, unpolished realism"

**Example 2: Direct-to-Camera Presentation**
```
Medium shot, looks directly into camera, adds subtle hand gestures, professional presentation style, warm lighting
```

**Breakdown:**
- Camera: "Medium shot"
- Behavior: "looks directly into camera, adds subtle hand gestures"
- Style/Mood: "professional presentation style, warm lighting"

**Example 3: Casual Vlog Style**
```
Handheld shot, casual and relaxed, gestures expressively while speaking, natural lighting, unpolished realism
```

**Breakdown:**
- Camera: "Handheld shot"
- Behavior: "gestures expressively while speaking"
- Mood: "casual and relaxed, natural lighting, unpolished realism"

**Example 4: Formal Presentation**
```
Static camera, medium shot transitioning to close-up, maintains professional posture, subtle hand gestures, formal presentation atmosphere
```

**Breakdown:**
- Camera: "Static camera, medium shot transitioning to close-up"
- Behavior: "maintains professional posture, subtle hand gestures"
- Mood: "formal presentation atmosphere"

**Example 5: Cinematic Storytelling**
```
Slow push-in from medium to close-up, character walks slowly and pauses, looks thoughtful, soft natural light, emotional atmosphere
```

**Breakdown:**
- Camera: "Slow push-in from medium to close-up"
- Motion: "character walks slowly and pauses, looks thoughtful"
- Mood: "soft natural light, emotional atmosphere"

### Prompt Optimization

**1. Be Specific About Motion**

Vague motion descriptions produce unpredictable results.

❌ Vague: "moves around"
✅ Specific: "walks slowly from left to right, pauses, turns to face camera"

**2. Specify Camera Clearly**

Camera behavior significantly affects the final result.

❌ Unclear: "good camera angle"
✅ Clear: "medium shot, static camera, eye-level perspective"

**3. Match Motion to Audio**

Consider what the audio contains when describing motion.

- **Energetic speech** → "gestures expressively, dynamic movement"
- **Calm speech** → "subtle hand gestures, measured movements"
- **Formal speech** → "maintains professional posture, minimal gestures"

**4. Don't Overcomplicate**

Simple, clear prompts work best.

❌ Complex: "walks while simultaneously gesturing and looking around and nodding and smiling and..."
✅ Simple: "walks slowly, adds subtle hand gestures, occasional smile"

**5. Use Cinematic Language**

Filmmaking terminology helps guide cinematic behavior.

- "Handheld shot" (implies slight camera movement, documentary feel)
- "Static camera" (implies stable, formal presentation)
- "Push-in" (camera moves toward subject, building intimacy)
- "Pull-out" (camera moves away, revealing context)

✅ **Supported Formats:**
- MP3
- WAV
- M4A
- AAC
- Common audio formats

❌ **Unsupported Formats:**
- Proprietary or uncommon formats
- Corrupted files
- DRM-protected audio

### Text Prompt Best Practices

**1. Focus on Motion Only**

Text prompt is for motion, not appearance or speech.

✅ **Motion-Focused:**
- "walks slowly, gives a half-smile"
- "adds subtle hand gestures"
- "looks directly into camera"

❌ **Appearance/Speech Descriptions:**
- "woman with long hair" (image handles this)
- "says 'hello everyone'" (audio handles this)

**2. Be Specific About Camera**

Camera behavior significantly affects output.

✅ **Specific Camera:**
- "medium shot, static camera"
- "slow push-in from medium to close-up"
- "handheld shot, eye-level perspective"

❌ **Vague Camera:**
- "good camera angle"
- "nice shot"
- "professional looking"

**3. Match Motion to Audio Energy**

Motion should complement audio content.

✅ **Matched Energy:**
- Energetic audio → "gestures expressively, dynamic movement"
- Calm audio → "subtle hand gestures, measured movements"
- Formal audio → "maintains professional posture, minimal gestures"

❌ **Mismatched Energy:**
- Calm audio + "gestures wildly, high energy"
- Energetic audio + "remains completely still"

**4. Use Cinematic Language**

Filmmaking terminology helps guide behavior.

✅ **Cinematic Terms:**
- "Handheld shot"
- "Static camera"
- "Push-in"
- "Pull-out"
- "Tracking shot"
- "Eye-level perspective"

❌ **Vague Terms:**
- "Looks good"
- "Professional"
- "Nice style"

**5. Keep It Simple**

Simple, clear prompts work best.

✅ **Simple and Clear:**
- "Medium shot, looks at camera, adds subtle hand gestures, professional atmosphere"

❌ **Overly Complex:**
- "Medium shot transitioning to close-up while simultaneously panning left and tilting up with handheld movement while character walks and gestures and looks around and..."

### Pitfall 2: Describing Speech in Text Prompt

**Problem:** Including dialogue or speech content in text prompt when audio already defines speech.

**Example:**
❌ "says 'hello everyone, welcome to my channel' while smiling"

**Why It's a Problem:**
- Audio already defines speech content
- Text prompt can't control dialogue
- Wastes tokens on irrelevant information
- May cause confusion

**Solution:** Focus on behavior while speaking, not speech content.

✅ "looks directly at camera while speaking, adds subtle hand gestures, friendly expression"

### Pitfall 3: Low-Quality Reference Image

**Problem:** Using low-resolution, blurry, or poorly-lit reference images.

- Energetic, fast audio + "remains completely still, minimal movement"

**Impact:**
- Unnatural, disconnected performance
- Confusing or jarring output
- Reduced believability

**Solution:** Match motion to audio energy and content.

✅ Energetic audio → "gestures expressively, dynamic movement"
✅ Calm audio → "subtle hand gestures, measured movements"

### Pitfall 6: Overly Complex Prompts

**Problem:** Writing extremely long, complex prompts with multiple simultaneous actions.

**Example:**
❌ "Medium shot transitioning to close-up while simultaneously panning left and tilting up with handheld movement while character walks forward and gestures with both hands and looks around and smiles and nods and..."

**Impact:**
- Model confusion
- Unpredictable results
- Some instructions may be ignored
- Difficult to debug issues

**Solution:** Keep prompts simple and focused.

✅ "Medium shot, walks slowly, adds subtle hand gestures, warm lighting"

### Pitfall 7: Expecting Style Change
