## Best Practices for Preset Selection

With so many presets to choose from, it can be overwhelming to know which one to use. Here are some best practices for selecting the right preset for your shot:

- **Consider the narrative purpose:** What is the story you are trying to tell? What emotion are you trying to evoke? Choose a preset that supports your narrative goals.
- **Match the preset to the subject:** Some presets are better suited for certain subjects than others. For example, the "Car Chasing" preset is obviously designed for vehicles, while the "Glam" preset is ideal for fashion and beauty shots.
- **Experiment:** Don't be afraid to try out different presets to see what works best. You can always undo and try again.
- **Combine presets:** For more complex shots, you can combine multiple presets in a video editor to create a unique and dynamic sequence.

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

- **Choosing the wrong preset:** The most common mistake is simply choosing a preset that is not appropriate for the subject or the narrative.
- **Poor image quality:** The quality of your input image will have a big impact on the quality of your output video. Make sure to use a high-resolution image with good lighting and composition.
- **Unrealistic expectations:** Higgsfield DoP is a powerful tool, but it's not a magic wand. Don't expect it to turn a bad photo into a masterpiece.

## Advanced Techniques
