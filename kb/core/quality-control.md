## Introduction

AI video generation is a powerful tool, but it's not always perfect. This guide provides a practical framework for identifying and fixing common issues in AI-generated video. We'll cover common artifacts, troubleshooting techniques, and a quality control checklist to help you refine your videos to a professional standard.

## Chapter 1: Common AI Video Artifacts

| Artifact | Description | Common Causes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Flickering** | Rapid, inconsistent changes in light, color, or texture | Conflicting style prompts, unstable models |
| **Morphing** | Unintended transformations of objects or characters | Vague prompts, long generation times |
| **Jitter** | Shaky or unstable camera movement | Overly complex motion prompts |
| **Inconsistent Style** | Abrupt changes in visual style or aesthetic | Lack of a strong visual bible or preset |
| **Poor Lip-Sync** | Dialogue does not match mouth movements | Models with weak audio-visual correlation |
| **Uncanny Valley** | Characters look almost human, but not quite | Imperfect facial generation, lack of micro-expressions |

## Chapter 2: Troubleshooting Techniques

### 2.1 The Iterative Refinement Loop

1.  **Isolate the Problem:** Identify the specific artifact or issue.
2.  **Simplify the Prompt:** Remove all but the most essential elements of your prompt.
3.  **Adjust One Variable at a Time:** Change one element of your prompt (e.g., camera motion, subject action) and regenerate.
4.  **Compare and Contrast:** Analyze the new output to see if the change improved or worsened the issue.
5.  **Repeat:** Continue this process until you've isolated the cause of the problem.

### 2.2 Model-Specific Troubleshooting

*   **Veo 3.1:** If you're having issues with character consistency, make sure you're using the "Ingredients to Video" feature with high-quality reference images.
*   **Runway Gen-4.5:** If you're getting unwanted motion, simplify your prompt and focus on describing only the desired motion.
*   **Kling:** For physics-related issues, try rephrasing your prompt to be more explicit about the desired physical interactions.
*   **Seedance 1.5 Pro:** For lip-sync issues, ensure your dialogue is clear and concise in the prompt.

### 2.3 Post-Production Fixes

Some issues are best fixed in post-production.

*   **Flickering:** Use a de-flicker plugin in your editing software.
*   **Jitter:** Use a warp stabilizer effect to smooth out shaky footage.
*   **Inconsistent Style:** Use color grading to create a more consistent look across shots.

## Chapter 3: The Quality Control Checklist

Before you finalize your video, run through this checklist:

**Visuals:**
- [ ] Is the style consistent across all shots?
- [ ] Are there any distracting artifacts (flickering, morphing, jitter)?
- [ ] Is the character consistency maintained?
- [ ] Is the lighting consistent and motivated?
- [ ] Is the color grading effective?

**Audio:**
- [ ] Is the dialogue clear and intelligible?
- [ ] Is the lip-sync accurate?
- [ ] Are the sound effects effective and well-timed?
- [ ] Is the music appropriate for the tone and mood?
- [ ] Is the overall audio mix balanced?

**Narrative:**
- [ ] Does the video tell a clear and compelling story?
- [ ] Is the pacing effective?
- [ ] Are the transitions smooth and logical?
- [ ] Does the video evoke the desired emotions?
