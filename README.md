<!-- Screenshots coming soon -->

## What Makes ShotPilot Different

While other AI tools give you generic results, ShotPilot combines:
- **Cinematic realism expertise** — 250K+ words of anti-artifact research tackling the #1 problem in AI imagery: making it look real, not "AI-generated." Plastic skin, HDR glow, uncanny lighting — we've documented every failure mode and how to fix it.
- **Expert model specialists** — handcrafted prompts for 9 API-connected models (FLUX, GPT Image, Grok, Kling, Seedream, Reve, Kontext, Nano Banana, Topaz) + Midjourney prompt generation
- **6-dimension quality analysis** — Physics, Style, Lighting, Clarity, Objects, Character consistency
- **AI-assisted creation** — Build character bibles and object libraries through AI chat assistants that suggest descriptions, generate reference prompts, and refine details. Import scripts and plan shots with Creative Director guidance.
- **User-in-the-loop control** — AI recommends, you decide, transparent cost tracking

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Environment variables for AI services:
  - `GEMINI_API_KEY` (Google AI Studio)
  - `FALAI_API_KEY` (fal.ai for FLUX, Grok, etc.)
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (GPT Image 1.5)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AiDevLab3/shotpilot-v2.git
cd shotpilot-v2

# Install dependencies
cd shotpilot-app
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Initialize database and start server
npm run dev
```

### First Project Setup

1. **Open ShotPilot**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Create Project**: Set your visual style, mood, and cinematography approach  
3. **Add Characters**: Upload reference photos and descriptions for consistent identity
4. **Script Import**: Paste your screenplay or treatment for context
5. **Scene Planning**: Break script into scenes with specific requirements
6. **Shot Design**: Use the Creative Director to plan individual shots
7. **Generate & Review**: Create images with AI, analyze quality, and iterate

## Core Features

### 🎬 Professional Workflow
- **Creative Director**: Import your script, define visual style and cinematography, collaborate with AI via chat sidebar
- **Character Bible**: Create characters with AI assistant that suggests descriptions, generates reference prompts, and analyzes uploaded photos
- **Object Library**: Build props, vehicles, locations with AI assistant for descriptions, prompts, and reference image analysis
- **Scene Manager**: Drag-and-drop shot planning with AI-designed shots, coverage analysis, and cohesion checks
- **Asset Manager**: Complete image library with version control and iteration chains

### 🎥 Cinematic Realism Engine
The biggest problem in AI-generated imagery isn't creativity — it's realism. Every AI model produces telltale artifacts: plastic-looking skin, impossible lighting physics, HDR glow, uncanny symmetry, depth-of-field inconsistencies. ShotPilot attacks this problem at every stage of the pipeline:

- **Prompt compilation**: The RAG Compiler automatically injects anti-artifact language, realism lock blocks, and filmic entropy instructions into every generated prompt — "avoid CGI, plastic skin, HDR glow, waxy texture" plus model-specific countermeasures. Core realism principles are loaded on every single generation, not just when you ask for it.
- **Contextual technique loading**: When generating a close-up, the compiler pulls in skin texture, portrait lighting, and facial realism chunks. Wide/establishing shots load spatial composition and environmental depth techniques. This is automatic based on shot type, mood, and lighting context.
- **Quality Gate scoring**: Every image is analyzed across 6 dimensions including dedicated realism and AI artifact scores. The gate loads realism principles and quality control packs from the KB to judge against professional standards — if a reference image "looks CGI," it flags it because downstream generations inherit and amplify that flaw.
- **Strategy Picker remediation**: When realism scores are low, the Strategy Picker maps specific issues to specific fixes — waxy skin → GPT Image edit for pore texture, flat lighting → re-generate with adjusted prompt, AI artifacts → targeted cleanup with the right editing model.
- **Prompt refinement loop**: When an image scores below threshold, the Refiner surgically adjusts only the weak dimensions while preserving what scored well — anchored to realism principles from the KB.

This isn't a feature bolted on top. Cinematic realism is embedded in the compilation, analysis, remediation, and refinement stages — it's the engineering backbone of the entire generation pipeline.

- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Complete system architecture
- **[VISION.md](docs/VISION.md)** - Product vision and business model
- **API Reference** - Interactive API docs at `/api/docs` (when running)

### Key Architectural Decisions

**Multi-Agent Design**: Specialized AI agents (Creative Director, Quality Gate, Strategy Picker) rather than monolithic AI for better domain expertise and modularity.

**RAG-Powered Knowledge**: 250K+ words of cinematography expertise accessible via contextual queries instead of static prompt templates.

**User-in-the-Loop**: No automated improvement loops - user controls every generation decision for cost transparency and creative control.

**Hierarchical Styling**: Project → Scene → Shot style inheritance allows consistency with scene-specific variation.

**Immutable Image History**: Parent/child relationships preserve full edit history while tracking costs and improvements.
