## 🚀 Current Production Status: MVP Technical Validation

We are currently validating the **Agentic Film Crew** logic—a specialized AI agent system that collaborates like a real film production team.

### The "One Roof" Advantage

Unlike storyboard platforms that automate the entire process into generic outputs, Cine-AI provides:

✅ **Natural Language Collaboration**  
Agents that collaborate from pre-production through final delivery, asking clarifying questions and offering expert suggestions.

✅ **Embedded Expert Brain**  
A 250k-word knowledge base that powers a specialized film crew (Creative Director, Chief of Staff, DP, Holistic Image Auditor, Motion Agent).

✅ **The Analysis Loop**  
Real-time feedback where agents analyze their own outputs across 6 dimensions and provide corrective adjustments.

✅ **Holistic Image Analysis**  
The Holistic Image Auditor evaluates every Hero Frame across physics, style, lighting, clarity, composition, and character identity.

✅ **Single-Model Exhaustion Protocol**  
Agents prioritize consistency by exhausting the primary model (3-Strike Rule) before suggesting external pivots.

## 🎬 The Agentic Film Crew

Cine-AI operates as a **specialized film production team**, not a single monolithic AI.

### Meet the Crew

**1. Creative Director**  
- Collaborates with you to formulate a cohesive creative vision
- Develops script and shot list through clarifying questions
- Creates Project DNA (theme, style, tone, mood, visual references)
- Adapts to your workflow (has script / vague idea / detailed vision)

**2. Chief of Staff (Producer Agent)**  
- Maintains project DNA (character SoulID, style, narrative intent)
- Orchestrates sub-agent collaboration
- Enforces protocols and makes pivot decisions

**3. Director of Photography (DP Agent)**  
- Expert in image model syntax (Imagen 3, Nano Banana Pro, etc.)
- Designs composition, focal length, aperture, and optical specs
- Generates "Hero Frame" stills

**4. Holistic Image Auditor**  
- Comprehensive image analysis across 6 dimensions (physics, style, lighting, clarity, composition, character identity)
- Provides detailed feedback and actionable suggestions
- 3-tier recommendation framework (LOCK IT IN, REFINE, REGENERATE)

**5. Motion Agent (Lead Editor)**  
- Expert in video model syntax (Veo 3.1, Sora 2, etc.)
- Ensures 24fps motion cadence and physics-based camera moves
- Receives optical metadata from DP for temporal consistency

**→ See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for complete crew manifest and collaboration protocols**
