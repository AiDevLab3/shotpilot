He wears a rumpled white dress shirt with a loosened dark tie, his face etched with the fatigue of a thousand sleepless nights. Marlowe is hunched over a desk, intensely studying a crumpled and water-stained business card. The scene is set in a dark private detective office late at night. The composition follows an IMAX 65mm aesthetic with an anamorphic 21:9 aspect ratio, using a shallow depth of field that focuses sharply on the texture of the business card and Marlowe’s hands. The lighting is strictly motivated by a single practical desk lamp, creating a high-contrast pool of warm 2700K amber light against deep midnight blue shadows. The frame exhibits raw photographed realism with natural film grain, realistic highlight roll-off, and physical entropy including micro-scratches on the desk and natural skin pores. No CGI sheen or waxy textures are present.",
