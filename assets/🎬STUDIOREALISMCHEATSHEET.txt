🎬 STUDIO REALISM CHEAT SHEET
Cinematic, Photographic AI Imagery

(With Camera & Lens Decision Tree)

CORE RULE

Realism comes from physics, not detail.
If a real cinematographer couldn’t say it on set, don’t put it in the prompt.

1. PHOTOGRAPHIC FOUNDATION

(Tell the AI it’s a camera)

Always anchor the image as photographed, not rendered.

Use:

raw photograph / cinematic still

captured through a physical lens

analog film / ARRI Alexa / IMAX color science

visible film grain

Depth of Field (intentional):

Faces → f/4–f/5.6

Environments / large scale → f/8–f/11

🚫 Avoid: hyper-detailed, 8K clarity, perfectly sharp everywhere

2. CAMERA & LENS DECISION TREE

(Use gear ONLY to enforce optical behavior)

STEP 1 — What are you shooting?

A. Face / Character Close or Medium

Goal: human realism, intimacy, natural proportions

Use:

35mm lens (cinematic intimacy) or

50mm lens (neutral realism)

f/4–f/5.6

Camera names optional

Lens behavior matters more than camera brand

B. Large Environment / Architecture / Stadium

Goal: scale, weight, depth

Use:

IMAX-scale realism or

large-format capture

35mm lens

f/8–f/11 (deep focus)

Camera names help here

C. Action / Movement / Transitions

Goal: physical realism, inertia

Use:

spherical lens

moderate focal length (35–50mm)

stopped down (f/5.6–f/8)

Avoid anamorphic unless you want distortion

STEP 2 — Do you actually need a camera name?

YES, if you need to enforce:

scale (IMAX / large format)

deep focus

restrained highlight rolloff

NO, if you just want “cinema vibes.”

Camera names are tools, not seasoning.

STEP 3 — Safe Camera / Lens Vocabulary

Pick ONE camera concept max:

IMAX-scale realism

large-format cinematic capture

ARRI Alexa Mini LF look

Pick ONE lens statement:

35mm lens (natural perspective)

50mm lens (neutral portrait)

spherical lens

Always include aperture intent:

f/4–f/5.6 → faces

f/8–f/11 → environments

🚫 Avoid stacking brands or listing multiple cameras/lenses

3. LIGHTING (MOST IMPORTANT)

Lighting determines realism more than anatomy.

Always specify:

light source (lamp, window, screen, streetlight)

direction (side, top-down, underlit)

contrast (deep shadows allowed)

Use:

practical / diegetic lighting

low-key lighting

natural falloff, no fill

pockets of darkness

🚫 Avoid vague phrases like “cinematic lighting”

4. ATMOSPHERE = DEPTH

Air must exist.

Use:

volumetric light

dust motes

haze / mist

light catching particles

5. TEXTURE, ENTROPY, TIME

Nothing should look new unless the story demands it.

Use:

weathered, worn, oxidized

sun-faded, chipped, scuffed

uneven wear, polished edges

Think history, not grunge overlays.

6. REALISM KILLERS (AVOID)

Instant realism death:

infinite clarity

perfect symmetry

flat, even lighting

floating subjects

pure RGB colors

over-described prompts

“epic,” “masterpiece,” “award-winning”

Constraint = realism

7. NEGATIVE PROMPT (ESSENTIAL)
CGI, 3D render, Unreal Engine, video game,
plastic skin, waxy texture, AI smoothing,
oversharpened, perfect symmetry,
HUD, sci-fi glow, stylized

8. FACE REALISM (CINEMATIC STANDARD)

Light first, face second

Visible pores, slight asymmetry

Restrained expression

Film-like contrast, gentle rolloff

🚫 Avoid flawless skin and overacting

9. HELMET / VISOR CHARACTERS

Golden rule: visor = glass, not a screen.

laminated ballistic optic

reflections, refraction, internal scatter

edge glow only

face slightly softer behind glass

🚫 No LED panels, no HUD glow

10. VIDEO REALISM (IF MOTION)

Camera has mass.

slow physical dolly

subtle handheld

deliberate crane

Environment must move (dust, haze, steam).
No floating, no zooms, no FPV chaos.

UNIVERSAL REALISM LOCK (PASTE ANYWHERE)
Photographic cinematic image captured through a physical lens.
Practical, motivated lighting with natural falloff and deep shadows.
Visible texture, wear, and imperfection.
Natural depth of field, film-like contrast, gentle highlight rolloff.
Atmosphere present in air and distance.
No CGI look, no stylization, no digital sharpness.

FINAL STUDIO PRINCIPLE

Use camera names for scale.
Use lens focal length for faces.
Use aperture to enforce realism.
Never use gear as decoration.
