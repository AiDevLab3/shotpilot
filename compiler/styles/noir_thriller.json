  "settings": {
    "colorPalette": "Desaturated teals, deep blacks, cold steel blues, sodium vapor amber accents. Shadows dominate 60%+ of the frame.",
    "lighting": "High contrast, motivated practicals only (neon signs, desk lamps, car headlights). Hard side-light with deep falloff. No fill light — let shadows go black.",
    "lensPreferences": "Anamorphic wide (2.39:1 aspect ratio), 40mm-65mm range, shallow depth of field with oval bokeh. Slight lens flare on point sources.",
    "mood": "Dread, unease, paranoid tension. The frame should feel like something bad is about to happen.",

    "customDirectives": [
      "Visible atmosphere: smoke, rain, fog, or haze in every shot",
      "Faces partially obscured by shadow — never fully lit",
      "Reflective surfaces: wet streets, glass, polished metal",
      "Color temperature split: warm practicals against cool ambient"
