    "colorPalette": "Warm earth tones, muted pastels, golden yellows, soft greens. Lifted blacks with slight fade. Think Kodak Portra 400 color science.",
    "lighting": "Soft natural light — window light, golden hour, overcast diffusion. Minimal artificial lighting. When practicals are used, warm tungsten only.",
    "lensPreferences": "Spherical 35mm with visible film grain, 28mm-50mm range. Moderate depth of field — backgrounds soft but readable. Slight vignetting.",
    "mood": "Intimate, melancholic beauty, quiet contemplation. Bittersweet. The beauty of ordinary moments.",

      "Visible film grain — not digital noise, organic 35mm texture",
      "Natural skin tones — no beauty filter, show pores and imperfections",
      "Practical locations over sets — the space should feel lived-in",
      "Negative space in composition — let the frame breathe",
      "Available light priority — if it looks 'lit', it's wrong"
