# Nano Banana Pro: Photo quality gets worse with each iteration. How to mitigate that?

When I create or alter photos with Nano Banana Pro, the photo quality gets worse and worse after each prompt. The first photo looks indeed photorealistic, but when I try to make minor adjustments to the photo there are increasingly more JPEG artefacts and distored faces, and with each iteration the photo looks more and more like an oil painting.

How can I mitigate/correct that? I've tried asking Gemini itself for a prompt ("...subjects are rendered with photorealistic fidelity, showing genuine human features and expressions. Zero CGI or painted effect. The focus is razor-sharp...") but that didn't help.
