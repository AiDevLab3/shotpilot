GPT‑4o (“o” for “omni”) is a step towards much more natural human-computer interaction—it accepts as input any combination of text, audio, image, and video and generates any combination of text, audio, and image outputs. It can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an average of 320 milliseconds, which is similar to human response time⁠

 in a conversation. It matches GPT‑4 Turbo performance on text in English and code, with significant improvement on text in non-English languages, while also being much faster and 50% cheaper in the API. GPT‑4o is especially better at vision and audio understanding compared to existing models.

Customer service proof of concept.

Prior to GPT‑4o, you could use Voice Mode⁠ to talk to ChatGPT with latencies of 2.8 seconds (GPT‑3.5) and 5.4 seconds (GPT‑4) on average. To achieve this, Voice Mode is a pipeline of three separate models: one simple model transcribes audio to text, GPT‑3.5 or GPT‑4 takes in text and outputs text, and a third simple model converts that text back to audio. This process means that the main source of intelligence, GPT‑4, loses a lot of information—it can’t directly observe tone, multiple speakers, or background noises, and it can’t output laughter, singing, or express emotion.

With GPT‑4o, we trained a single new model end-to-end across text, vision, and audio, meaning that all inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network. Because GPT‑4o is our first model combining all of these modalities, we are still just scratching the surface of exploring what the model can do and its limitations.

A first person view of a robot typewriting the following journal entries:

1. yo, so like, i can see now?? caught the sunrise and it was insane, colors everywhere. kinda makes you wonder, like, what even is reality?

the text is large, legible and clear. the robot's hands type on the typewriter.

Input

The robot wrote the second entry. The page is now taller. The page has moved up. There are two entries on the sheet:

yo, so like, i can see now?? caught the sunrise and it was insane, colors everywhere. kinda makes you wonder, like, what even is reality?

sound update just dropped, and it's wild. everything's got a vibe now, every sound's like a new secret. makes you think, what else am i missing?

The robot was unhappy with the writing so he is going to rip the sheet of paper. Here is his first person view as he rips it from top to bottom with his hands. The two halves are still legible and clear as he rips the sheet.

Model safety and limitations

GPT‑4o has safety built-in by design across modalities, through techniques such as filtering training data and refining the model’s behavior through post-training. We have also created new safety systems to provide guardrails on voice outputs.

We’ve evaluated GPT‑4o according to our Preparedness Framework⁠ and in line with our voluntary commitments⁠. Our evaluations of cybersecurity, CBRN, persuasion, and model autonomy show that GPT‑4o does not score above Medium risk in any of these categories. This assessment involved running a suite of automated and human evaluations throughout the model training process. We tested both pre-safety-mitigation and post-safety-mitigation versions of the model, using custom fine-tuning and prompts, to better elicit model capabilities.

GPT‑4o has also undergone extensive external red teaming with 70+ external experts⁠ in domains such as social psychology, bias and fairness, and misinformation to identify risks that are introduced or amplified by the newly added modalities. We used these learnings to build out our safety interventions in order to improve the safety of interacting with GPT‑4o. We will continue to mitigate new risks as they’re discovered.

We recognize that GPT‑4o’s audio modalities present a variety of novel risks. Today we are publicly releasing text and image inputs and text outputs. Over the upcoming weeks and months, we’ll be working on the technical infrastructure, usability via post-training, and safety necessary to release the other modalities. For example, at launch, audio outputs will be limited to a selection of preset voices and will abide by our existing safety policies. We will share further details addressing the full range of GPT‑4o’s modalities in the forthcoming system card.

Through our testing and iteration with the model, we have observed several limitations that exist across all of the model’s modalities, a few of which are illustrated below.

Examples of model limitations

We would love feedback to help identify tasks where GPT‑4 Turbo still outperforms GPT‑4o, so we can continue to improve the model.

As part of our Preparedness Framework⁠, we conduct regular evaluations and update scorecards for our models. Only models with a post-mitigation score of “medium” or below are deployed.The overall risk level for a model is determined by the highest risk level in any category. Currently, GPT‑4o is assessed at medium risk both before and after mitigation efforts.

Model availability

GPT‑4o is our latest step in pushing the boundaries of deep learning, this time in the direction of practical usability. We spent a lot of effort over the last two years working on efficiency improvements at every layer of the stack. As a first fruit of this research, we’re able to make a GPT‑4 level model available much more broadly. GPT‑4o’s capabilities will be rolled out iteratively (with extended red team access starting today). 

GPT‑4o’s text and image capabilities are starting to roll out today in ChatGPT. We are making GPT‑4o available in the free tier, and to Plus users with up to 5x higher message limits. We'll roll out a new version of Voice Mode with GPT‑4o in alpha within ChatGPT Plus in the coming weeks.

Developers can also now access GPT‑4o in the API as a text and vision model. GPT‑4o is 2x faster, half the price, and has 5x higher rate limits compared to GPT‑4 Turbo. We plan to launch support for GPT‑4o's new audio and video capabilities to a small group of trusted partners in the API in the coming weeks.
