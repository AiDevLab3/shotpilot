Parameter List

Control, customize, and enhance your images with parameters!
What are Parameters?

Parameters are like special instructions you can use to guide how your images turn out. They help you customize things, like changing the shape of an image, or using a Personalization profile. 

Using Parameters

Parameters always go at the end of your text prompt, after you've described what you want to see. Using them successfully is all about placement and formatting. 

Remember these tips for success:
Place Parameters at the End: Always put parameters after your prompt text.
Watch the Spaces: Add a space between your prompt text and the dashes. 
No Punctuation: Don't use commas, periods, or other punctuation marks in your parameters.

 vibrant California poppies--ar 2:3  (No space before the dashes)
 vibrant California poppies - - ar 2:3  (Extra space between the dashes)
 vibrant California poppies --ar 2:3,  (Using punctuation in parameters)
 vibrant California --ar 2:3 poppies  (Prompt text after parameters)
