Imagine being a film director, meticulously planning every detail — lighting, costumes, props, and emotions (not that I’d know exactly what they do). AI filmmaking makes this level of planning accessible to anyone, shifting the focus from big budgets to creative efforts. The Simulation Production Method applies this same deliberate approach to create visually cohesive films with emotional impact.

What if you could bring your creative vision to life to tell the stories you’ve always imagined?

Instead of generating visuals randomly, this method focuses on crafting purposeful stories that resonate with you and your audience. It’s about starting with what you want to watch, refining iteratively, and telling stories that matter while building bonds through shared storytelling.

Core Principles

These principles provide the foundation for crafting AI films that are both technically sound and emotionally impactful.

Consistency: Maintain a unified visual language across all scenes by setting clear parameters for framing, tone, and lighting. A consistent lighting setup, for instance, ensures every scene feels like it belongs to the same world.
Iteration: Be comfortable with a loop of testing, reviewing, and improving outputs. Adjust details such as a character’s expression, lighting, or pose, and repeat the process until it feels right. Creativity is not a straight line, it’s a cycle of discovery.

The Simulation Production Method is not a technical AI Workflow: it’s a mindset. It’s about creating intentionally, experimenting boldly, and rekindling the art of storytelling using modern tools and timeless human creativity.

If you’re more interested in experimenting with AI-generated visuals based on memory and perception, you might also enjoy Memory AI Art, a more open-ended, explorative approach to working with AI.

If you’re here for the practical steps, you’ll find them in the second half of this article. However, I encourage you to read through the other sections as well. While some concepts may feel repetitive, they are designed to help you internalize the approach, not just memorize steps.

Start with Pen and Paper

Before touching any AI tools or thinking about generation, the creative vision must be defined. This step is entirely analog — pen and paper, nothing else. By starting with a clear, heartfelt vision, you create something you genuinely care about, something meaningful. Ask yourself: What is the story? What emotions do you want to evoke? Who is the audience?

In a world where AI makes production power accessible, the key to resonance lies in creating something meaningful. Think of yourself as the first viewer: What would you love to watch? Start a storytelling circle — collaborate with friends by creating episodes together. It’s not about the final film; it’s about practice, bonding and growth.

Half of the Film’s Experience

A common pitfall in AI filmmaking is underestimating the power of sound design. The right music, ambient sounds, and even silence can elevate your visuals, immersing the audience and amplifying emotion.

Be Conscious of Your Footprint

While AI tools offer unprecedented production power, it’s important to acknowledge the ecological cost of generating content. Every generation uses computational energy, and this adds up.

Not every story needs to be created with AI, and not every frame requires the highest resolution. Consider stock footage from sources like Pexels to complement your scenes. Start with low-resolution tests (e.g., 480p) to explore your ideas. Reserve higher resolutions (e.g., 1080p) for finalized visuals that will truly matter in your narrative.

Step-by-Step Guide to Simulation Production Method
1. Define the Creative Vision

Every great film begins with a clear vision. This means defining the foundation of your simulated world. Start with pen and paper — no technology needed. Ask yourself: What is the story I want to tell, and why does it matter? What emotions do I want to evoke? Who is my audience, and how will this story resonate with them?

Think about the tone, environment, and mood: Is it futuristic, historical, or otherworldly? Does it feel hopeful, mysterious, or intense? Jot down rough ideas without worrying about perfection. Use this step to ground your creative vision and establish the “why” behind your story. This foundational clarity will guide the rest of your filmmaking process.

AI filmmaking opens up creative possibilities that were once out of reach for many. For instance, shooting a film in a supermarket is traditionally costly and logistically challenging. With AI, you can explore such scenes without those limitations. Imagine capturing the tension of a chance encounter in the frozen aisle or crafting a dramatic confrontation in an otherwise mundane setting — all from your creative vision, not a physical budget.

2. Build the Visual Framework

Creating a consistent visual framework is crucial for a unified look of your simulated world. This step involves defining two key components: a preset (1) and a seed prompt (2). Together, they form the backbone of your visual language, ensuring both consistency and dynamic storytelling.

The preset (1) establishes the foundational look and feel of your film. It defines elements like lighting, framing, and background to maintain visual consistency across all scenes. Small adjustments, like tweaking the lighting or framing, can significantly impact the overall look and feel of your visuals.

For example, consider a “Dutch Town” preset: “Traditional brick houses with gabled rooftops, cobblestone streets, and orderly rows of trees. Medium-wide framing captures architectural charm and quiet streets. Lighting is natural, diffused by an overcast sky.”

This preset provides a cohesive baseline, ensuring every scene feels like it belongs to the same world.

The seed prompt (2) layers storytelling elements onto the preset. It describes specific actions or moments within a scene, adding depth and narrative focus. For instance:
“A young woman stands near a lamppost in the cobblestone square, wearing a long coat and holding a letter. Her expression is thoughtful as she gazes toward a distant shop window.”
This seed prompt introduces movement, emotion, and context, transforming the preset’s static environment into a living scene.

By combining the preset (1) and the seed prompt (2), you create a powerful visual framework. The preset ensures tone and consistency, while the seed prompt drives the story forward, much like storyboarding — showing what is happening in each scene.

Together, they enable you to design a visually cohesive and narratively compelling film. Later in the article, you’ll find another example that illustrates how these elements work in practice.

3. Sketch the Narrative

This phase is about exploring your story visually and testing ideas with low-resolution outputs. Begin by dividing your narrative into segments like the beginning, middle, and end. Identify key moments that define your story’s flow and emotional impact.

4. Curate the Scenes

Once you’ve explored and expanded your visuals, the next step is to focus and refine. This phase involves selecting the best outputs, blending or remixing scenes, and ensuring your visuals align seamlessly with your story.

Start by reviewing your outputs to identify what works — such as compelling lighting, strong character expressions, or consistent tones — and what needs improvement, like awkward framing or visual mismatches. During this process, you may notice gaps in your narrative or missing transitions that need to be generated.

Work iteratively, addressing one aspect at a time. This is the convergence phase, where you shift from expanding possibilities to narrowing your focus on what best serves your story. By identifying and filling in any gaps, you’re on the right track to crafting a cohesive narrative. This is also where decision fatigue can set in, so make sure to take frequent breaks to maintain clarity.

5. Build your Narrative: Visuals and Sound

This is where your story truly comes to life, combining visuals and sound to create a cohesive and emotionally engaging narrative. It’s not just about arranging scenes — it’s about crafting a seamless flow that resonates with your audience.

Start by sequencing your refined visuals in a logical order. Focus on emotional flow, ensuring each scene transitions naturally to evoke the intended feelings. Use linking visuals or animations — like subtle camera movements or intermediate frames — to smooth transitions and maintain consistency.

Sound design plays an equally critical role in shaping your narrative. Gentle waves and soft wind can enrich a beach scene, while low, ominous tones heighten the tension in a confrontation. Layering sounds thoughtfully can create an immersive experience that complements your visuals.

Give sound design the same attention as your visuals, using it to enhance mood, evoke emotion, and add clarity to your film’s story.
