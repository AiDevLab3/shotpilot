**Good Prompting**



**Eyes focused slightly off-camera, catching a faint reflection from a practical light source.**



**Avoid:**



**“piercing gaze”**



**“intense stare”**



**Direct camera lock unless story demands it**



**6. FACIAL EXPRESSION MUST BE SUBDUED**



**Neutral ≠ lifeless.**

**Subtle ≠ blank.**



**Ask For:**



**“restrained expression”**



**“micro tension in jaw”**



**“calm, focused presence”**



**🚫 Avoid:**



**Big emotion labels (“angry,” “heroic,” “epic”)**



**Overacting faces**



**7. COLOR SCIENCE MATTERS**



**AI defaults to weird skin color unless guided.**



**Specify:**



**Natural skin tones**



**Slight warmth in highlights**



**Cooler shadows (for night)**



**Example**



**Natural skin tones with warm highlights and cooler shadow falloff, no color grading exaggeration.**



**8. PHOTOGRAPHY LANGUAGE BEATS ART LANGUAGE**



**Use cinematography terms, not art terms.**



**Good:**



**“ARRI Alexa color science”**



**“IMAX film grain”**



**“practical lighting”**



**“real-world exposure”**



**Bad:**



**“masterpiece”**



**“epic portrait”**



**“award-winning”**



**9. NEGATIVE PROMPTS (ESSENTIAL)**



**Always include:**



**no CGI look**

**no plastic skin**

**no waxy texture**

**no over-sharpening**

**no artificial symmetry**

**no video game character**



**10. THE GOLDEN RULE**



**If a real cinematographer couldn’t say it on set, don’t put it in the prompt.**



**SAMPLE “FACE REALISM LOCK” BLOCK**



**You can reuse this anywhere:**



**Photographic human face, shot on 35mm lens, natural depth of field.**

**Soft, motivated lighting with realistic shadow falloff.**

**Visible skin texture, pores, subtle imperfections, slight facial asymmetry.**

**Eyes naturally lit with soft reflections, calm focused expression.**

**Film-like contrast, gentle highlight rolloff, no digital sharpening.**

**Natural skin tones, cooler shadows, warm highlights.**

**No CGI look, no plastic skin, no stylization.**





**Of course. Creating cinematic, realistic images of faces with AI image generators requires moving beyond simple descriptions and stepping into the role of a film director and cinematographer.\[1] You need to build a scene, not just request a subject.\[2]**

**The key is to layer your prompts with specific photographic and directorial details. Here is a breakdown of the essential characteristics and directions to use.**

**The "Cinematic Recipe": A Four-Part Structure\[3]**

**To get the best results, structure your prompt by layering these four crucial elements. Think of it as building a scene from the ground up.**

**1. The Subject and Emotional Direction (The "Who \& Why")**

**Don't just describe physical features. "Direct" your subject to convey a specific mood or story.\[3] A face without emotion feels like a snapshot, not cinema.**

**Direct the Emotion: Instead of "a portrait of a man," try: "a candid portrait of a weary man with a thousand-yard stare," or "a joyful woman laughing with her head thrown back, eyes crinkled."**

**Specify the Action: Give them something to do or react to. "Looking out a rain-streaked window," "pausing in mid-conversation," or "taking a drag from a cigarette."**

**Keywords for Realism: candid, authentic moment, unguarded expression, raw emotion, documentary style, street photography portrait.**

**2. The Environment and Composition (The "Where \& How")**

**The setting and how you frame the shot are vital for storytelling.\[3]**

**Build an Atmosphere: The background should add to the story.\[3] "In a smoky, dimly lit jazz club," "on a bustling Tokyo street at night," or "in a sun-drenched, dusty apartment."**

**Use Compositional Rules: Guide the AI on how to frame the image.**

**Rule of thirds: Places the subject off-center for a more dynamic look.\[3]**

**Shallow depth of field or bokeh: Blurs the background to isolate the subject, a hallmark of cinematic portraiture.\[3]**

**Framing: Use elements in the foreground to create depth, like "shot through a doorway" or "over-the-shoulder shot."**

**3. Lighting Direction (The "Mood Maker")**

**Lighting is perhaps the most critical element.\[3] Never leave it to chance.**

**Natural Light: Golden hour (warm, low sun), blue hour (twilight), window light (soft and directional), overcast light (soft and even).**

**Dramatic \& Artificial Light: Chiaroscuro or Rembrandt lighting (high contrast with deep shadows), neon lighting (colorful, urban feel), practical lights (light sources visible on screen, like lamps).**

**Direction: "Side-lit to accentuate textures," "backlit to create a rim light halo," or "top-down lighting for a dramatic, moody feel."**

**4. The Photographic Toolset (The "Cinematographer's Eye")**

**This is where you add the final polish that makes an image look like film.\[3]**

**Lens Choice:**

**85mm lens: The classic portrait lens.\[3] Flattering compression and beautiful background blur.**

**50mm lens: A natural, "human eye" perspective. Great for documentary-style realism.\[3]\[4]**

**Anamorphic lens: Adds a widescreen aspect ratio, unique horizontal lens flares, and oval-shaped bokeh for a big-budget movie feel.**

**Film Stock Aesthetic: Mentioning specific films is a shortcut to a complex set of color, contrast, and grain characteristics.**

**Kodak Portra 400: Famous for beautiful, natural skin tones and fine grain.**

**Cinestill 800T: Perfect for night scenes with artificial light, known for its distinct red halation (glow) around lights.\[5]\[6]**

**Kodak Tri-X 400: A classic, gritty black and white film.**

**General Film Terms: Film grain, color grading, cinematic color palette (e.g., teal and orange), movie still.**

**Aspect Ratio: Don't forget to set the frame shape. Add --ar 16:9 or --ar 21:9 at the end of your prompt (for Midjourney) for a wide, cinematic aspect ratio.**

**Putting It All Together: Example Prompts**

**Here are a few examples showing how to combine these elements. Notice how they build a complete scene.**

**Example 1: Moody \& Introspective (Natural Light)**

**A candid portrait of an older fisherman with a weathered face, looking out a rain-streaked window at a stormy sea. His expression is contemplative and weary. Shot on Kodak Portra 400 film, with natural window light from the side, shallow depth of field, visible film grain, and a muted, desaturated color palette. Documentary style. --ar 16:9\[3]\[4]\[5]**

**Example 2: Vibrant \& Urban (Artificial Light)**

**A cinematic street photography portrait of a young woman with dyed hair laughing in a busy Tokyo alleyway at night. Her face is lit by the colorful neon signs reflecting off wet pavement.\[3] Shot with an anamorphic lens, showing horizontal lens flares and oval bokeh in the background. The mood is energetic and joyful. Cinestill 800T film aesthetic.\[3]\[5]\[6]\[7]\[8] --ar 21:9\[3]\[9]**

**Example 3: Classic \& Dramatic (Studio/Controlled Light)**

**A powerful, close-up portrait of a man with a stern expression, lit by dramatic chiaroscuro lighting that creates deep shadows on one side of his face. The background is dark and out of focus. Shot on a 85mm lens with a shallow depth of field.\[3]\[10] The image has a timeless, film noir quality with rich texture.\[1] Black and white film photograph. --ar 4:5\[3]\[11]**

**You are no longer just a portrait photographer; you are now a director blocking a scene, a costume designer, and a cinematographer lighting an entire space.**

**When you pull the camera back, the face becomes smaller, so the burden of storytelling shifts to body language, environment interaction, wardrobe, and overall composition.**

**Here is the expanded guide to prompting for cinematic, realistic characters in wider shots.**

**1. Directing the Body: The "Physical Performance"**

**In a medium or full shot, posture and gesture convey emotion more strongly than facial expression. You must direct the character's physical presence.**

**Replace Emotion with Posture: Instead of saying "a sad man," describe the physical manifestation of sadness.**

**Prompting: "Slumped shoulders, head bowed, hands buried deep in coat pockets."**

**Prompting: "Standing rigid with tension, fists clenched at their sides."**

**Specific Action over Generic Posing: Avoid static poses that look like a fashion catalog. Give them something natural to do.**

**Instead of: "A woman standing on a street."**

**Try: "A woman pausing mid-stride to check her watch on a busy street," or "A mechanic wiping grease from their hands with a rag."**

**The "Unguarded Moment": To achieve realism, aim for candid moments between actions.**

**Keywords: Candid, caught off guard, in motion, slight motion blur on limbs, naturalistic pose.**

**2. Wardrobe as Storytelling: The "Costume Design"**

**Clothing is a massive part of a character's visual identity in wider shots. It needs to look lived-in to be realistic. Imperfection is key.**

**Specific Materials \& Textures: Don't just name the item; name the fabric.**

**Keywords: Heavy wool peacoat, worn denim jacket, faded cotton t-shirt, scuffed leather boots, tweed suit.**

**Evidence of Wear and Use: Clothing in movies rarely looks brand new unless it's a plot point.**

**Keywords: Weathered, threadbare seams, sun-faded, stained, creased, dusty.**

**How it Fits: The drape of clothing adds realism.**

**Prompting: "An oversized coat swallowing their small frame," or "a tailored suit fitting snugly across the shoulders."**

**3. Interaction with the Environment: The "Blocking"**

**A character shouldn't float in front of a background; they must be physically grounded within it.**

**Physical Contact: Make them touch the world around them.**

**Prompting: "Leaning casually against a graffiti-covered brick wall," "sitting hunched over at a crowded diner counter," "kneeling in the dirt examining a plant."**

**Depth and Layers: Place elements between the camera and the character to create depth.**

**Prompting: "Shot through the rain-streaked windshield of a car looking at the character on the street," or "framed by foreground foliage."**

**4. Cinematic Framing for Bodies: The "Wide Shot"**

**You need to tell the AI how much of the body to show and where to place it in the frame.**

**Shot Scale Definitions:**

**Medium Shot (MS): From the waist up. Good for showing body language while still seeing facial reaction.**

**Cowboy Shot (or American Shot): From mid-thigh up. Classic for showing weaponry or tool belts.**

**Full Body Shot (LS): Head to toe. The environment is equally important as the character.**

**Environmental Portrait: The character is relatively small within a vast landscape or detailed room. This emphasizes scale and isolation.**

**Compositional Weight: Where are they in the frame?**

**Prompting: "Character positioned on the far left third of the frame, looking into the negative space on the right."**

**5. Lighting the Full Scene**

**Lighting a whole body in a space is harder than lighting just a face. The light needs to motivate the entire scene.**

**Separation Light: In wider shots, characters can blend into the background. Use rim lighting to pop them out.**

**Prompting: "A strong backlight creating a rim of light around their figure, separating them from the dark alley."**

**Motivated Light Sources: Where is the light coming from in the wide shot?**

**Prompting: "Lit by the warm glow of a streetlamp above them, casting long shadows on the pavement."**

**Atmospheric Lighting: Light interacting with the air adds immense cinematic value.**

**Keywords: Volume light, light rays, haze, fog, dust motes dancing in a shaft of sunlight.**

**Putting it Together: Expanded Example Prompts**

**Here are examples that combine the facial details with these new, wider-scope techniques.**

**Example 1: The "Environmental Portrait" (Vast scale, isolation)**

**A wide environmental portrait of an elderly rancher, a tiny figure standing alone in a vast, drought-stricken landscape at sunset. He is wearing dusty, worn denim overalls and holding a weathered hat in his hand, looking down at the cracked earth. His posture is defeated. The golden hour light casts very long shadows across the plains. Shot on Kodak Portra film, beautiful grain, grand cinematic composition showing the immense scale of the land. --ar 21:9**

**Example 2: The "Medium Shot" Action (Urban, energetic)**

**A medium shot candid photograph of a female bike messenger taking a break in a busy NYC alleyway. She is leaning against a brick wall, breathing heavily, helmet tucked under one arm. She wears a sweat-stained t-shirt and a heavy messenger bag with scuffed straps. Steam rises from a nearby vent. The lighting is a mix of overcast daylight and neon sign reflections. Shot on a 50mm lens, slight motion blur in the background crowd, raw documentary feel. --ar 16:9**

**Example 3: The "Cowboy Shot" Noir (Moody, character-driven)**

**A cowboy shot of a 1940s private detective waiting in the shadows of a rainy street corner at night. He wears a rumpled trench coat and a fedora pulled low. He is lighting a cigarette, the flame briefly illuminating the lower half of his grizzled face and hands. The rest of his body is in silhouette against the wet, reflective street. Film noir style, high contrast chiaroscuro lighting, visible rain streaks, Cinestill 800T film grain. --ar 4:5**















##### **FIX Images:**



Add heavy, realistic atmospheric haze and suspended dust particles throughout the entire stadium volume. The light from the central fluorescents and the distant truck headlights must scatter realistically through this haze (volumetric lighting), creating soft, diffused beams and deep atmospheric shadows, rather than sharp cones of light.



Apply heavy weathering, rust, grime, and dust to the central metal two-story structure, the lockers, and the equipment. The concrete floor in the center must look stained, cracked, and dirty, matching the debris in the immediate foreground. Nothing should look new.



Make the water puddles on the floor look realistic. They should be murky and dirty, not clear glass. The reflections in the water should be distorted, diffused, and broken up by ripples and surface scum, not perfect mirror images.
