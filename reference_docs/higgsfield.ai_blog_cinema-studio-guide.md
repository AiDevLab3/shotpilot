For too long, AI video generation has felt like a slot machine: you type a prompt, pull the lever, and hope the result looks good. If it doesn't, you try again burning time, credits, and creative energy.

Introducing Cinema Studio

We built Cinema Studio to shift the paradigm from "random generation" to deterministic direction. It is a standalone pro environment that simulates a physical film studio, giving you control over optics, physics, and motion. A professional filmmaking has never been this accessible.

What makes Cinema Studio different?

Unlike standard creation tools, Cinema Studio is designed with a "Hero Frame First" philosophy. By perfecting your still image before you animate, you ensure that lighting, composition, and character details are locked in.

Key Capabilities

True Optical Simulation: Full control over the rig build (camera settings). Select specific camera sensors (like the ARRI Alexa 35 or specific VHS profiles), choose your lens glass (e.g. Cooke), and set your focal length (12mm to 135mm).

Deterministic Motion Control: Stack up to 3 specific camera movements (e.g., Pan Right + Tilt Up + Zoom In) to choreograph exactly how the shot evolves.

Start & End Frame Precision: Need a shot to start on a face and end on a landscape? You can upload specific Start and End frames, and Cinema studio will handle the "tweens" (intermediate frames) for a perfect transition.

All Aspect Ratios and Multishot sequences.

Camera Presets: Team-curated cinematic looks, plus the ability to save your own signature setups.

Aperture Control: Real depth of field, shallow or deep focus, and cinematic bokeh.

Project Sync & Sharing: Collaborate on AI cinema projects with your team.

How to Use Cinema Studio: A Step-by-Step Workflow
Phase 1: Build the Rig (Camera Set-Up) & Shoot Your Image

The goal here is to create your "Hero Frame" - the perfect image that defines your video.

Enter the Studio: Click to the Cinema Studio in the top-navigational tab. 

Select Your Gear:

Camera: Choose a sensor profile. Select a VHS or Film profile for a nostalgic look. Go with a Digital Cinema if you aim for clarity.

Lens: Pick a lens character (e.g., Cooke for unique bokeh).

Focal Length: Decide your perspective.

12mm - 24mm: Epic landscapes or dynamic action.

50mm: Natural human perspective.

135mm: Compression for portraits and details.

Aperture Control: Adjust the camera aperture to dictate the exposure and depth of field of your shot. Use a wide aperture for portraits or macro shots to create brighter images with a sharp subject and blurry background. Use a narrow aperture for wide landscape shots with horizon in focus.

Write Your Script: Enter your prompt describing the scene, lighting, and subject.

Generate & Select: Hit generate. Review the batch.

The Handoff: Once you find the perfect image, hover over it and click "Use as ref for video". This seamlessly moves you to the animation phase with your look locked in.

Phase 2: Direct the Motion

Now that you have your Hero Frame, it's time to make it move.

Generate in The Director's Mode - Best for general cinematic movement.

Set Camera Moves: Select up to 3 movements. Example: Combine a "Truck Left" with a "Pan Right" for a parallax effect.

Adjust Timing: Set your duration and toggle Slow Motion if you want that dreamy, high-frame-rate look.

Generate: Our model will animate your scene while strictly adhering to the visual style of your Hero Frame.

Conclusion: The Major Shift is Already Here

Cinema Studio was built to make AI video generation feel more structured and controllable, because the fastest way to reach a cinematic result is to treat the process like a real shoot, where you first establish a strong Hero Frame that locks lighting, composition, and character detail, and only then move into animation with a clear plan for optics and motion. 

With gear-style controls for camera profiles and lens behavior, Cinema Studio turns the workflow into something that is easier to refine, which is why it works equally well for quick weekly content and for professional shots that need consistency across multiple takes.
