## Slide 2: The Challenge of Character Consistency
**Heading:** Why Character Consistency is AI's Hardest Challenge

Maintaining a consistent character across different AI-generated images has historically been one of the most difficult tasks in AI image generation. Traditional approaches using text descriptors (often called "anchor strings") typically fail because the model creates slightly different interpretations of the same character with each generation. Even minor changes in scene, lighting, or pose can result in a completely different-looking person or subject.

**Key Points:**
- Text-only descriptions produce inconsistent results across multiple generations
- Scene changes, lighting variations, and pose adjustments compound inconsistency
- Traditional "anchor strings" fail to capture the full visual identity of a character
- Without visual references, AI models reinterpret character features each time
- Professional workflows require reliable character consistency for storytelling and branding

## Slide 3: The 360-Degree Character Sheet Solution
**Heading:** The 360-Degree Character Sheet Method Solves Consistency Through Visual References

The most reliable way to achieve character consistency with Nano Banana Pro is to build a comprehensive visual reference library called a "360-degree character sheet." This method replaces unreliable text descriptions with actual visual references that the AI can use to maintain consistent features, proportions, and styling across all subsequent generations.

**Key Points:**
- Visual references replace unreliable text-only descriptions
- Provides the AI with a complete understanding of character features from all angles
- Enables consistent character placement across diverse scenes and contexts
- Two-step process: Generate reference sheet, then use for new scenes
- Industry-standard technique adapted from animation and film production

## Slide 4: Step 1 - Generate the Reference Sheet
**Heading:** Building Your Character's Visual DNA: The Reference Sheet

The first step is to generate a comprehensive reference sheet showing your character from multiple angles. This creates a visual database that captures every aspect of the character's appearance, from facial features to clothing details. Generate 2-3 images of your character showing different perspectives: front view (looking directly at camera), side views (looking left and right), and back view.

**Key Points:**
- **Front View:** Character looking directly into the lens with neutral expression
- **Side Views:** Character turned to show left and right profiles
- **Back View:** Character turned around to reveal back perspective
- Include consistent lighting and styling across all reference angles
- Capture fine details: skin texture, hair styling, clothing fit, and accessories

**Example Prompt for Front View:**
"A studio portrait of a young woman, looking directly into the lens. She has a neutral, sophisticated expression. Her face has visible pores, subtle freckles, and natural skin grain. The lighting is soft and directional, highlighting her facial structure and the sharp tailoring of her charcoal grey suit."

## Slide 5: Step 1 - Creating Additional Angles
**Heading:** Complete the Reference Sheet with Side and Back Views

After generating the front view, use conversational editing to create the remaining angles. Each subsequent prompt builds on the original image, ensuring consistency across all reference angles. This approach maintains the character's core features while revealing different perspectives.

**Editing Prompts for Additional Angles:**
- **Back View:** "Using this image, show the woman turned around so we see her back."
- **Left Profile:** "Using this image, make this woman look left."
- **Right Profile:** "Using this image, make this woman look right."

**Key Points:**
- Use conversational editing to maintain consistency across angles
- Each angle reveals different aspects of character design
- Reference sheet serves as visual anchor for all future generations
- Save all reference images in high resolution for maximum fidelity
- Consider generating additional angles for complex characters (three-quarter views)

## Slide 6: Step 2 - Use References for New Scenes
**Heading:** Deploy Your Character Across Unlimited Scenes with Perfect Consistency

Once your 360-degree character sheet is complete, you can use these reference images to place your character in any scene, context, or situation while maintaining perfect consistency. Upload the reference images and explicitly instruct the AI to maintain the character's features while changing the environment, action, or mood.

**Key Points:**
- Upload reference sheet images alongside your new scene prompt
- Explicitly state: "Keep the person's facial features exactly the same as the reference images"
- Change environment, lighting, pose, and action while maintaining character identity
- Can combine multiple reference images for complex compositions
- Supports up to 14 reference images (6 high-fidelity objects, 5 human characters)

**Example Prompt Structure:**
"Using these reference images, place this woman in [new scene description]. Keep her facial features, hair, and overall appearance exactly the same as the reference images. Change only [specific elements like pose, expression, or clothing if needed]."

## Slide 7: Real-World Application - Storyboarding Example
**Heading:** From Character Sheet to Professional Storyboard in Minutes

The 360-degree character sheet method enables professional storyboarding workflows. For example, creating a four-shot storyboard for a luxury watch advertisement with the tagline "The luxury of being first" becomes straightforward when you have a consistent character reference.

**Storyboard Shot Examples:**
1. **Shot 1:** Character seated in luxury vehicle, checking watch, city lights blurred outside
2. **Shot 2:** Character on minimalist lakeside villa terrace at dawn, focused expression
3. **Shot 3:** Close-up of character watching lake at dawn, contemplative mood
4. **Shot 4:** Over-shoulder shot focusing on character's hand and watch by the lake

**Key Points:**
- Each shot maintains perfect character consistency using reference sheet
- Lighting, environment, and mood change dramatically between shots
- Character's facial features, proportions, and styling remain identical
- Professional-quality results without expensive photoshoots or 3D modeling
- Enables rapid iteration and creative exploration

## Slide 8: Advanced Tips for Maximum Consistency
**Heading:** Pro Techniques to Ensure Flawless Character Consistency

Beyond the basic 360-degree method, several advanced techniques can further enhance character consistency across your AI-generated images. These professional-grade approaches address common pitfalls and maximize the reliability of your character references.

**Key Points:**
- **Match Aspect Ratios:** Use reference images with aspect ratios similar to your target output (vertical for mobile, horizontal for cinematic)
- **Start from Original:** Always edit from the highest-quality reference image, not previous generations, to avoid quality degradation
- **Use PNG Format:** Re-upload images as PNG, not JPEG, to preserve maximum detail and prevent compression artifacts
- **Explicit Instructions:** Always include phrases like "Keep facial features exactly the same" to reinforce consistency
- **Incremental Changes:** Make small, specific edits rather than requesting multiple simultaneous changes

## Slide 9: Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them
**Heading:** Avoiding the Three Most Common Character Consistency Mistakes

Even with the 360-degree character sheet method, certain mistakes can compromise consistency. Understanding these pitfalls and their solutions ensures professional-quality results every time.

**Pitfall 1: Iteration Chains**
- **Problem:** Editing from previous edits compounds artifacts and degrades quality
- **Solution:** Always return to the original reference sheet for new scenes

**Pitfall 2: Vague Instructions**
- **Problem:** Generic prompts like "keep the same person" allow too much interpretation
- **Solution:** Use explicit language: "Keep facial features, proportions, and styling exactly the same as reference images"

**Pitfall 3: Mismatched Contexts**
- **Problem:** Placing character in drastically different contexts without proper bridging
- **Solution:** Use aspect ratio matching and describe how character fits into new environment
