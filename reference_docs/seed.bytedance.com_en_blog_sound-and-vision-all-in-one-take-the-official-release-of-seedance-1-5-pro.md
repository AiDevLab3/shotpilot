With high-precision audio-visual synergy, the model can deeply integrate speech, imagery, and contextual atmosphere to generate finely detailed and coherent outputs, thereby enhancing the narrative impact of the content.

In close-up shots, the model demonstrates a refined ability to capture subtle emotions. Even without dialogue, it can sustain emotional buildup through delicate facial expressions. For example, in the generated cinematic-style cyberpunk video below, the model can infer the story context based on the prompt and precisely portray the character's emotional journey, ensuring the emotional transitions are natural, multi-layered, and in harmony with the environment and musical ambiance.




Note for viewing demo: Turn up the volume for a better experience.

Text-to-video prompt: A cyberpunk scene set in ruins, featuring an interplay of cool and warm light. A handheld shot tracks a young East Asian woman. A close-up on her repressed grief and tear-filled eyes transitions to a micro-expression of gentle resolve as her face is bathed in the golden light of sunrise. The character's skin should have an authentic film grain texture, with a shallow depth of field creating a soft-focus background.

Beyond generating single, impactful shots, Seedance 1.5 pro can also construct a narrative sequence of multiple camera shots based on a single prompt. For example, when creating an anime scene, the model can produce a continuous sequence showing fireworks, a couple confessing their feelings in Japanese, and an emotive vocal performance, all woven together with fluid narrative logic.







Text-to-video prompt: Anime-style summer fireworks festival, with fireworks casting a gentle contour light. The shot pushes in from a wide view of the fireworks to the male and female leads in yukata among the crowd, then cuts to a close-up capturing the girl steeling herself to confess. The boy bashfully starts, "実は... (Actually...)" but the girl beats him to it, confessing, "大好きです (I love you)." As they express their feelings, they share a close embrace. The sounds of fireworks, crowd ambiance, and Japanese dialogue blend together, creating a romantic and cohesive narrative atmosphere.

2. Catering to Demanding Scenes with Professional Camera Control and Dynamic Tension

With enhanced camera control and dynamic tension, Seedance 1.5 pro is now better equipped to generate visually complex and challenging scenes.

The model can more smoothly render high-dynamic, high-impact motion scenes. In the skiing video below, through the synergy of sound and visual motion, Seedance 1.5 pro creates a strong sense of immersion: The camera makes fast lateral cuts closely following the skier's trajectory and captures the moment of snow bursting into the air with fine detail, authentically recreating the speed and power of the extreme sport.




Image-to-video prompt: A skier, clad in professional gear, demonstrates agile techniques against a backdrop of snowy mountains. The shot follows the skier down the slope with a long, low-angle take, capturing the carving turn and the instant when snow bursts into the air. It then quickly cuts to a slow-motion close-up before tracking the skier as they exit the turn. The background music features upbeat Future Bass, complemented by whooshing wind sounds, creating an overall vibrant and energetic atmosphere.

The model also features autonomous camera scheduling capabilities, enabling the execution of complex movements for generation scenarios demanding high precision. For example, when simulating a red carpet premiere scene, the model can generate rapid panning shots that convey the scene's hustle and bustle. Coupled with the female subject's clear narration, this effectively recreates the ambiance of the event.




Text-to-video prompt: An Asian fashion blogger in an evening gown appears on the red carpet, exclaiming excitedly, "The air is thick with the scent of perfume and ambition! The red carpet tonight is like a live show of fashion history. Follow me, and let's go capture that show-stopping moment!"

In the generated promotional video for a robotic vacuum cleaner, the camera slowly pushes forward in a commercial style and closely tracks the movement of the robot, maintaining strong focus on the product itself.




Text-to-video prompt: In a modern, minimalist mansion, the reflection of the setting sun glimmers on a marble floor. A premium black floor washer machine works autonomously, its soft blue light scanning for dust. Camera work involves a low-angle tracking shot that follows the machine closely at floor level, highlighting its sleek, streamlined contours. The audio includes a female AI narration: "It's the dust you can't see that triggers allergies. With laser dust detection and intelligent power adjustment, we give you back the freedom of walking barefoot on your floors."

3. Enhancing Comedy and Other Stylized Performances with Support for Multiple Languages and Dialects

Seedance 1.5 pro supports multilingual speech generation, capable of rendering the vocal prosody of languages such as Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, and Indonesian with relative naturalness. Particularly in Chinese contexts, the model can also simulate various regional accents, including Sichuanese and Cantonese, providing more authentic performance quality for short dramas and other entertainment content.

For example, if a panda is munching on bamboo and suddenly turns to the camera to complain in a Sichuan dialect, the model can align its facial expressions with the dialect's unique prosody, breathing vivid life into the video.




Text-to-video prompt: Realistic, high-end footage. In a bamboo grove, a real panda is munching on bamboo, but abruptly stops to complain in Sichuanese: "今天的竹子咋有点老哦！啷个的喃？有点造孽哦~ (This bamboo is a bit tough today! What's up with that? This is a raw deal!)" Then, the camera does a quick push-in to a tight close-up as the panda tilts its head, gives a sly grin, and leans in to whisper: "喂，摄像的大哥，帮我点个外卖要得不！要微辣的哈！(Hey, Mr. Cameraman, can you order me some delivery? Make it just a little spicy!)".

4. Boosting Immersion in Gaming and Other Audio-Visual Content with Precise Sound Effect Generation

Beyond human voices, Seedance 1.5 pro demonstrates a solid understanding of ambient sound effects and musical atmosphere. It can layer ambient sounds based on the on-screen visuals to create spatial awareness, achieving a "what you see is what you hear" effect.

In a pixel-art game clip, the model not only provides fluid camera work that follows the character's running and jumping but also generates 8-bit sound effects in sync with the scene, demonstrating its audio-visual synergy in fast-paced action.




Text-to-video prompt: 8-bit pixel art style. A hero is running and jumping against the sunset, complete with a scanline effect and a retro video game soundtrack.

In a 3D-style game clip, the model generates a richly detailed open world. As the character moves, footsteps and breathing sounds are precisely synchronized, complemented by the distant, low cawing of crows, enhancing the immersive experience of audio-visual interaction.




Image-to-video prompt: A 3D game CG video. A man in a leather jacket explores the ruins of an abandoned church. He pauses cautiously, then dashes forward after ensuring the coast is clear, stopping abruptly at an archway to survey his surroundings. The shot uses backlighting from a high window on the left, presented in warm sepia tones. The audio precisely layers footsteps, heartbeat sounds, and owl calls, complementing the tense background music to create a suspenseful atmosphere.

Leveraging these capabilities, Seedance 1.5 pro provides powerful support for genre-specific creation such as films, ads, short dramas, and anime. Especially in image-to-video tasks, the model demonstrates robust style consistency, effectively maintaining stable character features during multi-shot transitions and complex movements, thereby improving the coherence from raw footage to final production.
