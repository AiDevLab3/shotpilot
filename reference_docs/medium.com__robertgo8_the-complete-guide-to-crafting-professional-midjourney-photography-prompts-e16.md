How I Turned AI-Generated Images from Amateur to Award-Worthy with One Simple Framework

Have you ever spent hours tweaking Midjourney prompts, only to get results that look nothing like the professional photography you envisioned? You’re not alone.

As someone who’s generated thousands of AI images, I’ve learned that the gap between “good enough” and “stunning” isn’t about the AI — it’s about how you communicate with it. Just like a professional photographer needs to understand aperture, lighting, and composition, creating photorealistic AI images requires mastering the language of photography.

Today, I’m sharing a comprehensive prompt engineering framework that transformed my Midjourney workflow. This isn’t about shortcuts or magic formulas — it’s about understanding what makes photography work and translating that into AI prompts.

The Problem with Generic AI Prompts

Most people approach Midjourney like this:

“Beautiful portrait of a woman, professional photo”

The result? Generic, inconsistent images that scream “AI-generated.”

Here’s why: Midjourney is incredibly powerful, but it needs specific direction. When you say “beautiful portrait,” the AI has to guess:

What type of portrait? (Headshot, environmental, fashion editorial?)
What lighting? (Soft window light, dramatic studio, golden hour?)
What lens? (35mm environmental or 85mm compressed?)
What mood? (Corporate professional, artistic dreamy, candid natural?)

Without these details, you’re rolling the dice every time.

The Solution: Think Like a Professional Photographer

The breakthrough came when I stopped thinking like a prompt writer and started thinking like a photographer. Every professional photo shoot involves specific decisions about equipment, lighting, composition, and post-processing.

Your AI prompts should too.

I developed an 8-component framework that mirrors real photography workflows:

The 8-Component Photography Prompt Framework
Subject Description — Who or what, with specific details
Photography Style — Genre and artistic references
Technical Details — Camera, lens, film type
Lighting Setup — Source, quality, direction
Composition — Framing, angle, depth of field
Atmosphere & Mood — Emotional tone and color grading
Camera Settings — Aperture, shutter speed, ISO implications
Midjourney Parameters — Optimization for best results
Real-World Example: Before and After

Before (Generic Prompt):

Professional business portrait, good lighting

After (Framework-Based Prompt):

Professional corporate headshot of confident young tech entrepreneur, male in early 30s, wearing casual smart blazer over t-shirt, natural genuine smile, shot with Canon 85mm f/1.2 lens at f/2, soft window light from camera left creating gentle shadows, modern minimalist office background with subtle bokeh, shallow depth of field, LinkedIn profile style, approachable yet professional atmosphere, clean color grading --ar 4:5 --stylize 300

See the difference? The second prompt gives Midjourney specific creative direction rather than vague aspirations.

The Complete Framework Documentation

I’ve compiled everything I’ve learned into a comprehensive guide that covers:

10 Photography Styles with detailed examples (Portrait, Landscape, Product, Street, Fashion, Architecture, Cinematic, Wildlife, Food, Fine Art)
Advanced Lighting Vocabulary (Golden hour, Rembrandt lighting, rim light, high-key/low-key setups)
Composition Principles (Rule of thirds, leading lines, framing, negative space)
Camera & Lens Selection Guide (When to use wide-angle vs. telephoto vs. macro)
Midjourney Parameter Optimization (Aspect ratios, stylize values, chaos settings)
Professional Photographer References (Ansel Adams, Annie Leibovitz, Steve McCurry styles)
Commercial Photography Templates (E-commerce, lifestyle, automotive)
Troubleshooting Common Issues (Fixing sharpness, lighting, composition problems)
The Full Framework

Below is the complete prompt engineering framework. Feel free to copy, modify, and use it for your own projects:

## 🔧 Prompt Structure Framework
### Essential Components

[SUBJECT] + [PHOTOGRAPHY STYLE] + [TECHNICAL DETAILS] + [LIGHTING] + [COMPOSITION] + [ATMOSPHERE] + [CAMERA SETTINGS] + [MIDJOURNEY PARAMETERS]

### Detailed Breakdown
1. **Subject Description** (What)
   - Main subject with specific details
   - Secondary elements and context
   - Human characteristics (age, expression, clothing)
2. **Photography Style** (Genre)
   - Portrait, Landscape, Street, Fashion, Product, Architectural, Documentary, etc.
   - Artistic movement references (if applicable)
3. **Technical Details** (Equipment)
   - Camera type (DSLR, Medium Format, Film Camera)
   - Lens specifications (24mm wide-angle, 85mm portrait, 200mm telephoto)
   - Film type (Kodak Portra 400, Fujifilm Velvia 50)
4. **Lighting Setup** (How)
   - Natural light (golden hour, blue hour, overcast, harsh midday)
   - Artificial light (studio lighting, rim light, backlight, soft box)
   - Light quality (soft, hard, diffused, dramatic)
5. **Composition** (Framing)
   - Rule of thirds, leading lines, symmetry, negative space
   - Camera angle (eye-level, low-angle, bird's eye view, worm's eye view)
   - Depth of field (shallow DoF, deep focus)
6. **Atmosphere & Mood** (Feel)
   - Emotional tone (melancholic, joyful, mysterious, serene)

   - Weather conditions (foggy, rainy, sunny, stormy)
7. **Camera Settings** (Technical)
   - Aperture (f/1.4 for bokeh, f/16 for landscape)
   - Shutter speed (long exposure, freeze motion)

8. **Midjourney Parameters** (Optimization)
   - `--ar` (aspect ratio: 16:9, 4:5, 1:1)
   - `--style` (raw, scenic)
   - `--stylize` (0-1000, controls artistic interpretation)
   - `--chaos` (0-100, variation control)
   - `--quality` (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2)

## 📋 Task Workflow
### Step 1: Requirement Analysis
Ask the user to provide:
- **Photography subject** (person, landscape, product, etc.)
- **Desired style** (editorial, cinematic, vintage, minimalist, etc.)
- **Mood/atmosphere** (dramatic, soft, energetic, calm)
- **Specific requirements** (aspect ratio, color preference, reference photographers)

- Proposing complementary composition techniques
### Step 3: Prompt Construction
Build the prompt following the structure:

[Subject description], [style reference], [camera and lens], [lighting setup], [composition details], [mood and atmosphere], [color grading], [quality keywords] — ar [ratio] — stylize [value] — chaos [value]

### Step 4: Optimization & Variants
