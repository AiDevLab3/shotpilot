# ShotPilot Product Vision

## What ShotPilot Is

ShotPilot is an AI cinematography copilot that transforms any filmmaker's creative vision into professional-grade imagery. Think of it as having a 250,000-word film school education, combined with expert knowledge of 10+ AI image models, working alongside you as your personal creative director, quality auditor, and technical advisor—all focused on one goal: helping you create cinematic images that look like they belong in a real movie, not like "AI art."

## The Problem We Solve

**The Core Issue:** Current AI image generation produces amateur results because users lack professional cinematography expertise and model-specific knowledge.

### Specific Pain Points

**For Independent Filmmakers:**
- "I know my character needs to look consistent across 50+ shots, but I don't know how to make Midjourney remember what he looks like"
- "My images look 'AI-ish' but I can't figure out what's wrong or how to fix it"
- "I get great results from FLUX sometimes, terrible results other times—I have no idea why"

**For Content Creators:**
- "I have a clear vision but my prompts are just 'handsome detective in rain'—they're too basic"
- "Every AI tool gives different results and I don't know which one to use when"
- "I spend hours iterating on prompts when I should be focusing on storytelling"

**For Creative Directors:**
- "My team needs consistent visual development but everyone's using AI differently"
- "We need professional quality but get amateur-looking results with plastic skin and HDR glow"
- "I need to maintain visual continuity across complex projects with multiple characters and scenes"

## Who It's For

### Primary Users
- **Independent Filmmakers** creating short films, proof-of-concepts, or storyboards
- **Content Creators** making professional video content for brands or social media
- **Creative Directors** in advertising agencies managing visual campaigns
- **Film Students** learning cinematography principles while creating portfolio work

### Secondary Markets
- **Concept Artists** in games/film needing rapid visual exploration with consistent characters
- **Authors** creating covers and promotional materials for their stories
- **Corporate Creative Teams** producing marketing materials with cinematic quality

## Why ShotPilot Is Different

### 1. Deep Domain Expertise
We've embedded 250,000+ words of film industry knowledge into every prompt. Where other tools offer generic "prompt enhancement," ShotPilot understands f-stops, lighting ratios, lens choices, and film terminology. It's the difference between asking a random person to help with your photography vs. hiring a professional cinematographer.

### 2. Model Specialization
Each AI model has unique strengths—FLUX 2 excels at photorealism, Midjourney at aesthetic excellence, GPT Image at character consistency. ShotPilot has handcrafted expert prompts for 10+ models, written as if each model's own engineers were describing optimal use. You get the best of every model instead of generic one-size-fits-all prompts.

### 3. Professional Quality Analysis
While other tools give simple pass/fail feedback, ShotPilot provides 6-dimension analysis: Physics, Style, Lighting, Clarity, Objects, and Character consistency. It tells you not just "this needs work" but specifically "the key-to-fill lighting ratio suggests harsh midday sun while your background shows golden hour—switch to motivated lighting for realism."

### 4. Project-Wide Continuity
ShotPilot remembers everything—your characters, scenes, style preferences, even which shots work well together. It maintains context across your entire production so shot 47 still matches shot 3, even weeks later.

### 5. User-in-the-Loop Control
Unlike automated AI systems, ShotPilot puts you in control. AI recommends, you decide. Every generation is a conscious decision with full cost transparency. You're not surrendering creative control—you're augmenting your expertise.

## The Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Foundation (Creative Director)
- **Script Input**: Upload your screenplay or treatment
- **Project DNA**: Define visual style, mood, cinematography approach
- **Character Bible**: Upload reference photos and detailed descriptions
- **Object Library**: Key props, vehicles, locations with reference images

### Phase 2: Pre-Production (Scene Manager)
- **Scene Breakdown**: Organize script into manageable scenes
- **Shot Planning**: Define camera angles, movements, compositions per scene
- **Coverage Analysis**: Identify gaps in your visual coverage
- **Cohesion Check**: Ensure shots will cut together seamlessly

### Phase 3: Production (Asset Manager + Agents)
- **Intelligent Generation**: AI selects optimal model and crafts expert prompts
- **Quality Gate**: 6-dimension analysis of every generated image
- **Iterative Improvement**: Targeted fixes based on specific quality issues
- **Character Tracking**: Automatic consistency verification across all shots

### Phase 4: Post-Production
- **Visual Continuity**: Final cohesion check across entire sequences
- **Export Preparation**: Organize assets for editing workflow
- **Documentation**: Complete production notes for future reference

## The Technology Behind It (Non-Technical Explanation)

### Knowledge Base System
Imagine a film school professor with encyclopedic knowledge who can instantly recall every technique for making skin look realistic, every method for achieving cinematic lighting, every trick for maintaining character consistency. That's our knowledge base—250,000+ words of cinematography expertise instantly searchable and contextually relevant.

### AI Agent Specialists
Instead of one generic AI, ShotPilot employs a team of AI specialists:
- **Creative Director**: Interprets your vision and selects the right model
- **Quality Gate**: Analyzes results with professional-grade critique
- **Strategy Picker**: Recommends specific improvements based on identified issues
- **Continuity Tracker**: Ensures character and style consistency across shots

### Model Expertise System
Each AI image model (FLUX, Midjourney, GPT Image, etc.) has different strengths and requires different prompting approaches. ShotPilot includes handcrafted specialist knowledge for each model—like having a dedicated expert who knows exactly how to get the best results from that specific tool.

### RAG-Powered Context
When you're working on a close-up shot, ShotPilot automatically loads knowledge about facial realism, lighting ratios for portraits, and character consistency techniques. When you're doing an establishing shot, it loads spatial composition principles and environmental depth techniques. You always get exactly the expertise you need for what you're creating.

## The Opportunity

The AI image generation market is worth $1.8B annually and growing 20%+ year-over-year, but most tools are horizontal platforms trying to serve everyone. ShotPilot targets the $4.2B film and video production market with vertical specialization.

Professional filmmakers spend $50K-$500K on concept art, storyboards, and pre-visualization. We can deliver 80% of that value at 5% of the cost while maintaining creative control and professional quality standards.

The competitive moat is deep domain expertise that would take competitors years to replicate. Every day of use adds more context to our knowledge base, creating network effects that strengthen our advantage.

**ShotPilot isn't just another AI tool—it's the future of cinematic pre-production, democratizing professional filmmaking knowledge for creators at every level.**
